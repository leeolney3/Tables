Pangle,"11th St. Playhouse, located on 11th and Morrison in Portland Oregon offered a wide range of performances, from vaudeville to boxing matches to economic courses, you name it they had it. Cost of admission ranged from twenty five cents to five dollars depending on the event. Events that costed $5 were operas and lower prices were seen in performances like ""Her Unborn Child."" The newspaper posting of for this theatre mainly showed up on the club activities page and only advertisements for the events coming up were on these pages, not many descriptive text about past performances were found. According to a post from the Oregon Daily Journal, this theatre housed 1400 comfortable seats including floor and balcony seats (4). 

The 11th street playhouse seemed to show many performances of ""Her Unborn Child- The Truth About Birth Control"" (2). There were many advertisements for this ""ladies only"" show in 1917 I found at least three different advertisements on Newspapers.com (2). Other types of shows that occurred at this Playhouse theatre included a home economics course that was done annually and seemed to be done at least three years in a row (3). Another type of performance that took place at this theatre was boxing matches (4). Many newspaper clippings were found for all these types of events and it seemed as though their promotional techniques were used to advertise to all ages men and women, specifically women for the Unborn child performance. They wanted to get the community more involved with their theatre by providing a wide range of shows to attend. Not only did they want to entertain but they wanted to educate with the use of economic classes and ""The Truth About Birth Control,"" they met everyones needs. 

11th St. Playhouse Theatre signed an agreement August 1, 1918 to replace the theatre with the new Alcazar Theatre. The new manager, C. V. Everett made plans to refurnish the lobby and dressing rooms (1). ",NA,"1. ""Playhouse Deal Closed,"" Morning Oregonian, August 01, 1918:12. Historic Oregon Newspaper.

Minnick","The exact date of Acme Theater's opening is unknown. However, Polk's Portland City Directories points to the opening year being 1910, as Acme Theater does not appear in the 1910 city directory (1), but does appear in the 1911 city directory (2); Polk's Portland City Directories information, usually, pertains to the year prior, i.e. the 1910 city directory has the census data from 1909. Also, the earliest found newspaper advertisement, a help wanted ad found in The Morning Oregonian, is from January 29, 1910 (8), further pointing to the Acme Theater opening sometime in 1910, more than likely in January of 1910.

Acme Theater's exact closing date is, also, unknown. However, Acme Theater stops appearing in Polk's Portland City Directories 1916 edition (7) and Acme Theaters last found advertisement, an advertisement in The Morning Oregonian for the film serial The Exploits of Elaine, is from April 10, 1915 (9), which points to the Acme Theater closing sometime in 1915, after April 10th of that year. So, it can be assumed that Acme Theater operated from 1910-1915. 
Acme Theater, Portland, Oregon, 1915. Image courtesy of Oregon Historical Society.Acme Theater went through 3 different ownership's in its short amount of time being open. The first owners, according to the 1911 Polk's Portland City Directory edition, were O'hare and Curran (2), no first names were given. They only owned Acme Theater for a year, as the 1912 city directory shows Martin B. Donovan being the manager of the theater (3). Martin B. Donovan appeared to be a prolific theater owner, as he also owned, for a period of time, the Victoria Theater and the Portsmouth Theater (10, 11). Donovan owned Acme Theater for 3 years (3,4,5), he stopped appearing as the owner of Acme Theater in the 1915 city directory. In the 1915 city directory C. E. Minnick appears as the manager of the theater (6), his ownership is short-lived, as Acme theater does not appear in the 1916 city directory, meaning they went out of business under his ownership. 

      
            There doesn't seem to be many advertisements, in the newspapers, for Acme Theater. This could mean that they didn't spend much money on advertisements because they were a smaller theater, they could have used fliers instead to promote their theater, or the management just didn't think that they needed to promote the theater as it could have been in a highly-dense populated area. Acme Theater's sign also appear to be pretty small and not very flashy, which, along with the lack of advertisements, points to the theater possibly being a relatively small theater.

Acme Theater was, primarily, a motion picture theater. In The Morning Oregonian, Acme theater was part of a list of theaters that was showing the film serial The Exploits of Elaine (12); a film serial is an episodic film, telling the story in pieces weekly. Also, in Polk's Portland City Directories Acme theater is listed under the moving picture section, not under the vaudeville theater section (2-6). However, Acme Theater did appear to show at least some vaudeville acts, as the theater did have help wanted ads, from The Morning Oregonian in 1910, that were, specifically, looking for a vaudeville team (13). This makes sense as Acme Theater appears to be a smaller theater, which means that they would, more than likely, show both films and vaudeville acts to increase their audience base.

The Alameda was built in the late stages of 1925 and had its grand opening on May 06, 1926. Leo, Oscar and Celia Seltzer, siblings who grew up in Portland and started a chain of movie theaters, were the owners of the Alameda Theater. In the below article, from the newspaper: The Oregon Statesmen, ""new incorporations are discussed throughout the article. The Alameda Theater  is introduced in the article as a new incorporation led by Leo, Oscar and Celia Seltzer, the owners of the theater. Also added into the article is the price of $15,000 which seems to be the price of the venture.
The Oregon Statesmen, July 10, 1926, Pg. 3, Oregon Historic Oregon Newspapers.The Alameda Theater was a 600 seat theater that housed performances both on and off of the screen. One of the main things that brought people to the movie theater were the showing of motion pictures. The owners of the theater were the Seltzer siblings, who were graduates from Lincoln High School, who built a chain of theaters in the Portland area, including: the Alameda, the Highway and the Oregon Theater. The brother's father built the first Columbia Theater in Portland, it is easy to say that movie theaters were in their blood (2).

      
            Pinterest, Today's View of the Same Building Where the Alameda Theater StoodOne of the main things that I found while researching the Alameda Theater, or rather lack of things, was that there were no advertisements for the theater itself. I searched diligently to find ads for anything and everything that the theater may have put on during its time in Portland. However, one of the notable details that I did find about the theater was the architect who built the theater in the year 1925.

As shown in the article from the Beaverton Enterprise, Walter E. Kelly is introduced. Kelly was an architect from Everett Washington, found himself in Portland during the year 1925 and was chosen by the Seltzer brothers to be in charge of the building on 30th and Alberta Street, The Alameda Theater. Today, the building is still the same looking as it did back in the day. The exterior still looks much as it did 74 years ago, with its distinctive Mediterranean clay tile roof and stucco walls. The theater has become several different businesses and places throughout the years of Portlands life, including several churches and other theaters; today, the corner of 30th and Alberta street is home to the Alberta Rose Theater which is a great honor to one of Portlands historic buildings like this.

Schultz, F.W. Walters","After months of pleading notices in the Albany Democrat, the Albany Grand Opera House opened in September of 1902 (2).
Albany Democrat, Aug. 16, 1901, p. 4. Newspapers.comAlbany Democrat, June 28, 1901, p. 4. Newspapers.com.Many different events occurred in the Albany Opera House. For example, orchestra music, vaudeville acts, choirs, religious services, dramas, plays, moving pictures, etc. Prices ranged from 5-75 cents depending on the content/event ($1.36-$20.33 in 2018) (3).

      
            Newspaper items for the Opera House typically included the who, what, where, and when the event would be held, along with an endorsement of the quality of the event and talent of the performer (4). They often included sayings such as “never attempted before!” to catch readers attention. They provided detailed descriptions of the material that was going to be shown as well as follow-ups on how the audience responded to certain events. Also, they included critic reviews of upcoming events/performers (5).

The Albany Opera House included moving pictures in its programming at least as early as 1906 when they showed the filmed boxing match between Jimmy Britt and Battling Nelson (6). The ticket prices for this show were particular interesting: 25, 50, and 57 cents. It made me wonder about the random pricing of 57 cents. How and why did they come up with the idea of 57 cents? This was the only time I encountered a pricing such as this one.

Harry Holmes, took over management in 1906. He promised to provide the audience with the best vaudeville performances that they had ever witnessed before, along with the most recent moving pictures courtesy of ""special arrangements"" with the Edison Moving Picture company (7).

The Albany Opera House changed ownership in 1917 and became the Family Theatre (8). ",NA,"1. [""Dr. J.L. Hill has bought the Monteith property...:], Albany Democrat, June 21, 1901, p. 3. Newspapers.com.

Programs changed three times a week, on Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays, with a matinee every afternoon at 2:30 pm.

The owners promoted the theater with ads and articles in the Roseburg Review newspaper, touting “extra fine showings” in order to attract audiences to the newly opened theater.

The space on W. Cass St. in downtown Roseburg was formerly occupied by the Vitagraph, which is described as located in the Matthews Building at Cass and Rose Streets. The space seems to have continued as a moving picture venue, at least through 1912. Sanborn Fire Insurance Maps are only available for Roseburg for this time period for 1903 and 1912.

One evening the house could be packed with organized mothers hellbent on doing their civic damnedest to raise money for the children during a violin-laced PTA benefit show (so long as the musicians are not on strike). Another day, you might find yourself nonplussed as a charismatic street urchin robs you before making a swift getaway via a passing streetcar.
""Woman Robbed of Watch,"" Morning Oregonian, 21 Dec, 1916.More often than not, however, in those early days of the Alhambra, you were likely to be a local neighborhood schmoe wanting to see that latest picture from Paramount that you’d otherwise have to go downtown to see, at one of the big movie palaces. That was the success of the Alhambra theater, its ability to have one foot in the neighborhood, and one foot in Hollywood.
""Moving Picture Benefit a Success,"" Oregon Daily Journal, 28 Feb, 1914.Most of the advertising from this time showed the Alhambra as part of a collective theatre in-group, established likely by the film exchanges of the day, such as Pathe Pictures, which would regularly promote the Alhambra as a second showing theater. However, there is evidence that the Alhambra was organized with other theaters beyond Pathe and Paramount’s advertisements.

      
            ""East Side's Favorite Theatre"", Oregon Daily Journal, 16 Aug, 1914.In 1921, The Oregon Daily Journal photographed a meeting during Associated First National Pictures, Inc.’s national convention that year. Pictured as being in attendance was Stephen Parker, owner of the Alhambra. There is a bit of a chicken and the egg situation here, because it is unclear which came first, participation with prominent film exchanges leading to an invite into the AFNP, or vice versa, but what is clear is that the Alhambra theater, while being a key component to its neighborhood, was also highly connected outside of it.

It was fairly difficult to determine the exact year that the Alhambra came into being, seeing as there is no mention of the theatre between 1913 and 1922 in Polk’s Portland City Directories of those same years. There was also very little information in the newspapers about the Theatre, save for block-booking advertisements and a few public notices for events or minor criminality. The only time I was able to find mention of an owner or ownership was in the caption that accompanied Parker’s photograph at the AFNP national convention. Also found more success using Newspapers.com, rather than Historic Oregon Newspapers, which was mostly the same series of recycled adverts over and over.

Campbell","The Aloha Theatre was part of the great movie theater land rush in Eugene between 1909-1912. Manager Ray M. Walker advertised the Aloha as “The Home of Great Vaudeville,” but movies were a regular part of the programming. For example, one week featured two separate contortionists, a musical novelty act, a “comedy playlett,” and 2,000 feet of “classy pictures,” along with a live orchestra. The Aloha also featured the filmed prize fights that were very popular at the time, such as the famous match between Jack Johnson and Stanley Ketchel in 1909.

The Aloha resided at 561 Willamette St., a long and narrow space on a busy block with a bank, two jewelers, and a barber.

General admission to the Aloha ranged from 10-20¢ for adults and 5-10¢ for children, with reduced prices for matinee shows. The Aloha ran regular ads in the Eugene Daily Guard, and offered a special admission coupon for reduced-price admission in 1909.

Local theater entrepreneur J.J. (Joseph) Bryan purchased the Aloha in early 1912, taking on E.L. Campbell as co-owner in April. They changed the name to the Savoy in October 1912 and continued with Ray Walker as manager.

Alta,"117 E. Alta St., Pendleton, Oregon","Pendleton, OR",45° 40.31667' N,118° 47.18333' W,1913-09-06,1913,1955-01-01,1955,550,"C.E. Oliphant, Charles M. Stype, E. L. Cooper, John Greulich, Mr. Deery, Mr. Chandler","Opening in 1913, by manager and owner C.E. Oliphant, the Alta Theater quickly became an exhibition juggernaut in Pendleton by actively seeking out quality performances for the theater and implementing high efficient promotional techniques. Competition was prolific seeing that many well established theaters had already inhabited the Pendleton area such as The Cosy, Pastime, Oregon, and the Grand. However, Mr. Oliphant was no rookie in the exhibition world. He had previously owned a theater and was well equipped with the knowledge of how to run and promote a business, an established network of connections throughout the industry, and a wife who was an entertainer and performed at the theater.

Upon opening, the Alta hit the ground running throughout 1913 by actively finding quality performers and acts bringing attention rapidly to the theater in its preliminary stages. With so many quality acts so early, the theater achieved a reputation of “high class” very early and earn a level of prestige that could almost be seen as haughty.
East Oregonian, Sept. 25, 1914, p. 9. Historic Oregon Newspapers.In fact, one of the first and most efficient moves by the management was signing with General Film Co.’s “exclusive services” (1). This enabled the theater to receive the company’s top of the line films before other exhibitors. One of the pioneer theaters, the Pastime, actually responded with an article in the East Oregonian trying to denote the level of prestige that this title gave by giving a more banal description of what the program entails (2). 

      
            Complementing the excellent acts, Mr. Oliphant promoted the theater relentlessly throughout the first couple of years. Within the first couple of months of business, Oliphant had the city place one of its two new public water fountains in front of the Alta, a subtle technique that seemed to work (4). Oliphant made sure that the theater was well known for its quality performances, but he also utilized the venue with several events that were city wide and open to the public, showing the quality of the theater. Memorials, club benefits, and other events were used to show and tell the theater letting everyone know that they were efficient and well equipped to entertain anyone (5).

Everything stated was done in 1913, its opening year! The outstanding management by Mr. Oliphant did not go unnoticed. Late in 1913, a convention for motion picture exhibitors of Oregon was called in Portland and the top managers from theaters throughout the state which Mr. Oliphant was promptly invited to as the Pendleton representative (6). The following year, the Alta progressed just as efficiently if not more efficiently. To further the quality of the theater, Oliphant purchased a $3500 Fotoplayer, which is essentially a hybrid of several instruments including a piano, organ and a few others (7). It required a musician with great talent to be used effectively properly, which only attracted more patrons to the theater. Along with this, the theater started to portray a new approach to advertising: sex appeal. Newspapers began to regard the quality of the female performers the Alta had to show and how they were a more sophisticated type of beauty that dressed modestly and had a type of class not normally found in performing women (8). In March 1914, Oliphant collaborated with some of the local clothing shops and had a “style show” with the latest fashion and “pretty girls” to show them off (9). This was a strategic move seeing as some of the main competitors in the Pendleton areas, such as the Orpheum and the Pastime, had reputations of securing “clean” content for their viewers. The Alta was able to give their viewers what its competitors could not, in a relatively dignified and classy manor both upholding its reputation and rendering itself a sort of edgy and ambitious institution.

One of the last moves that really put the Alta on top, was in May of 1914 when the managers of Alta signed a contract with Pathe to receive weekly motion pictures of current events (10). By doing this, it allowed the Alta to have fresh stories weekly keeping their frequent viewers informed with the most recent events as well as highly entertained. By this time the Alta had become a seemingly unstoppable force in the exhibition industry of Pendleton  in a mere span of two years, and continued to be one of the most dominant theaters in Pendleton for many years.",NA,"C.

Riddle","The Antlers theater was located at the corner of Jackson and Lane street next to the Elks Lodge in Roseburg Oregon. They served food items such as popcorn and held events such as matinees, moving pictures and magicians. Ticket prices ranged from ten cents to one dollar. To attract more attention, the owners painted the name on the side of the building so passing cars would see it and stop.

Ownership of the theater passed through multiple hands over its lifetime, including Mr. and Mrs. E.A. Gross, who also managed the Liberty and Majestic theaters in Roseburg. C.E. Oliphant purchased the theater in 1914 after the previous manager declared bankruptcy. Oliphant conducted renovations before reopening the business. In an article, he expressed his dedication to the town and his new theater. He said, “I shall improve the picture projecting end by immediately installing additional machinery of the latest design, a new screen will be added and set well back in the stage” (1). This shows the ongoing improvements made to the theater to keep up with the latest technology, which implies that enough patrons were coming to the theater in order for the owners to pay for upgrades.
Roseburg Review, Oct. 1, 1913, p. 1. Newspapers.com.In October 1930, Antlers closed and reopened as the Indian theater, and proceeded to continue success for several more years. In 1969, the building burnt down because of a popcorn oil fire, according to one local.

The Arcade “electric theatre” opened in April of 1909 in the Martin building, however the precise location of the original Arcade theater is a little hard to pin down. 

The 1912 Lane County directory for Cottage Grove lists the Arcade Theatre at 504 Main St. That contemporary address is the corner of 5th and E. Main St. (currently home to Abraxas Video). However, the 1912 Sanborn Fire Insurance map (below) indicates a movie theater was located on the block between 6th and 7th. The theater later moved to 429 Main St. next to the J.C. Penney’s department store (below). The entire block burned down in a fire in 1963.

            Regardless, the Arcade was a downtown fixture in Cottage Grove for decades through the 1960s. The theater opened as a movie house and films were always a central part of the programming, although like most small-town theaters the Arcade also featured a variety of vaudeville, music, boxing films, live theater, and lecturers. The Arcade also served as a community event space for clubs and organizations to meet.

Over its first few decades as a theater, it had a high turnover in owners and managers until the 1920s when the Morelock family bought the theater. They sold it in 1931 and then resume ownership sometime soon after, as news items report William Morelock as owner/manager in the mid-1930s.
Cottage Grove Leader, July 19, 1910, p. 8. Historic Oregon Newspapers.The Arcade’s promotional strategies remained largely consistent throughout its years of operation. Managers ran regular ads in the local newspapers to announce programming. In the early days, there were “beautiful baby” contests, merchandise giveaways, and benefit shows for local community groups. The Arcade made a point of highlighting the moral and educational value of its shows. On Sundays in 1910, for example, audiences could attend a “complete sacred set of pictures and songs.”

      
            Cottage Grove Leader, Apr. 5, 1910, p. 5. Oregon Historic Newspapers.Cottage Grove Leader, Oct. 15, 1909, p. 2. Historic Oregon Newspapers. 

      
      
  
          
            Since Cottage Grove is a small town the advertisement and events held in the theater were focused on families and children in order to promote an environment that the whole family could enjoy. Ranging from best baby contests to hygiene films for males and females, all the events could appeal to a wide audience. The advertisements could be a grand affair and take up half a page in the local newspaper. One of Morelock's marketing strategies was having other local businesses sell theater tickets at a discounted price. 

In order to keep up with the ever-changing times, there were many additions to the theater over the years. In 1912 the theater added a grand piano to the theater and attendance rose instantly. Cleo Morelock had a Western Electric sound system installed in 1928. This was still relatively early in the trend of converting to sound and was a great business move due to the popularity of sound. There were also many renovations done over the years the most significant being an addition of a coffee shop to the facade of the building and redoing it entirely in 1948.

In Exhibitor’s Herald, managers Meyers and Ford regularly submitted brief reports about pictures were screened, the audience’s perception, and generally if the film was profitable. Most of the motion pictures screen at the Arcade Theater were around 7 reels, and were shown in La Grand about one year after they were initially released.

The Arcade Theater is known to have shown the following motion pictures:

The Journey’s End (1921) – mixed reviews. They lost money showing this picture
Exhibitor's Herald, Jan. 22, 1922, p. 67. Media History Digital Library.
	Clay Dollars (1921) – It was only an “Average program picture.” This is one limitation of these brief reports. There is so little room to really get into specific details of how the picture was received. Perhaps most significantly, it is important to keep in mind that these reports are being written from a business perspective, and do not necessarily represent an actual aesthetic analysis of the film.
	
	
	The Fox (1921) –  Film is described as a “Good Western, but did not draw.”
	
	
	False Kisses (1921) – This film was not successful at all.
	
Exhibitor's Herald, Jan. 22, 1922, p. 71. Media History Digital Library.
	The Barbarian (1920) – Did not generate significant revenue. However, the managers speculated that this may have been the result of the recent winter holidays limiting theater attendance.
	
	
	Lavender and Old Lace (1921) – This motion picture is described as being especially popular among female audiences.
	
	
	The Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse (1921) – This picture received glowing reviews from theater managers.

	Cheated Hearts (1921) – Very little description is given for the exhibition of this picture, other than that it was a “fair program picture to fair business one day.”
	

      
            I have found that the managers at these theatres often reference a show at their theatre in response to how well it did in other cities. This is a great strategy in developing hype around an entertainment event and makes it much more grandiose sounding. Which is why they are able to charge much more than the usual picture or theatre show. Below is a clip from the La Grande Observer from Don C. Myers (Manager)
La Grande Evening Observer, Apr. 17, 1926, p. 5. Newspapers.com.The Arcade changed hands in 1930 and was re-christened the Liberty, which continued to serve La Grande into the 1990s.

When the Arcade theater first opened its doors on October 12th in 1903, raised at the hands and wallet of S. Morton Cohn and managed by Edward Shields, at (SW) 330 Washington St and in between Seventh and Sixth St. Later, after street renovations occurred, the theater was still in the same geographic position, but the theater was then at 627 Washington St, contained by the streets Broadway and Sixth. Shields, a man known for his success in the industry of amusement from his own namesake theaters and others, was highly regarded among the Portland exhibitors. Cohn found his theater in a busy part of the town that would likely offer many chances to gain audience members for any one of his three to five shows in a single day. The foundation of this specific theater was established under the concept that it would be like no other theater that locals had seen. As technology advanced and people's desires were focused, entrepreneurs like Cohn attempted to hone the craft of exhibition and display a higher level of vaudeville that was able to integrate many acts, while maintaining routine crowds and quality content.

A Confrontational Start

Before the contracts for the Arcade began in 1903, there were connections established between proprietor, S. Morton Cohn, and manager, Edward Shields. Cohn likely was aware of the track record of Shields and his other successful theaters, thus prompting thoughts of security at the Arcade. However, within the business aspect of early amusements like play-houses and moving picture houses, it is not far-fetched to claim that personalities often did not get along all of the time. Within the first month of business at the Arcade, Cohn had already fired Shields under reasons of incompetency and that his work ""was unsatisfactory from the first day."" Though potentially difficult to see the value of such an article, one must look at such sources through the lens in which they were formed; look to establish a perspective for the person who may have written the source. Shields in Portland in the early 1900's was a fairly influential man who set many of the trends when it comes to exhibition in the city. For Cohn, somewhat of a newcomer to the industry, to claim and outright denounce his practices and methods as not functional for a business was likely a huge slam to the business of exhibition, and in a way gave a chance for smaller theaters to prosper over large circuits. It is mentioned at the end of the clipping from Nov. 1903 that Cohn doesn't wish to appoint a manager or ""receiver"" because what a theater should rely on drawing a crowd is the content and performers, not the name associated with the show -- potentially another way that Cohn gained viewership is through the intricate programming of diverse shows.
Morning Oregonian, Nov. 7, 1903, page 12. HON 

      
            The First and Foremost

A seemingly key factor in the promotion of the Arcade theater surrounds the fact that the Arcade has consistently claimed that it was Portland's first so-called ""continuous vaudeville"" house. The combination of these two words implying two things: one will seemingly always  be able to see shows if they were to walk up to the ticket booth and that there were to be enough variety within a week that clients would desire to return. In a way, it seemed as though the Arcade was making attempts to capitalize on the varying degree of classes they had attending shows. One promotional article on the opening of the house notes that each and every seat in the house is only a dime, though, for that dime at another point in the week, one could see a completely different show at the same theater. 
Morning Oregonian, Oct 8, 1903, page 9. OHNMorning Oregonian, Oct 8, 1903, page 9. OHNVariety also maintained the allure of being the first to present such format, as the appeal of ""continuous"" was that guests would be able to frequently attend at their decided time and still be frequently entertained. This can be seen in Cohn's first programming at the Arcade where a clipping from the Morning Oregonian in 1903 details shows from ""necromancers and crayonists,"" ""comedy artists,"" an ""eccentric juggler,"" ""monologists,"" ""illustrated songs"" and some shows from the polyscope to close. Though following a contemporary formula, it is also a successful painting of an image of just how much content managers and proprietors had to ensure their theater could provide to stay relevant. One thing that may not exactly translate easily to more modern times,is that many storefronts and locations were being converted to theaters around this time of the 1990's as this form of exhibition begins to take off in the country and in Portland specifically.","The theater end date is an approximation, it is not clear through the research if the theater reopened under new management after renovation., The Arcade theater is often labelled as ""Portland's first continuous vaudeville house.""","Historic Oregon Newspapers.

The theater was known to show live plays and other acts accompanied by short films, as many nickelodeons did at the time. The theater had Sunday showings that were exclusively devoted to serials and short films. The programming featured seven reel installments which included serials like Lucille Love, the Girl of Mystery (1914), which was Universal Pictures’ first serial production. The Aurora would choose one serial and play it consecutively; showing one episode a week. This strategy catered to the local audience who routinely came to follow the serial stories. This was probably the only viable strategy for film exhibition in such a small town, as it would have been too expensive to show feature-length films. The Aurora Theatre often encouraged entire families to come to see the shows in the local Aurora Observer newspaper, and conveniently hosted showings right after worship at the Presbyterian Church.

Although documentation is sparse, the Aurora Theatre was only open for a short time from late 1915 to sometime in 1918; the last mention of the theater by name in the Aurora Observer appeared on Mar. 21, 1918. For a town with a population in the low hundreds at the time, Aurora played host to two theaters, one being the Aurora and the other being Sim’s Theatre (which had a similar lifespan to the Aurora). The Sim’s Theatre had different programming but followed the same model as the Aurora. Presumably, competition between the two theaters led to their collective demise.

The building was designed in the style that would be seen in the Middle East or the Mediterranean, which is fitting for the name Bagdad. The architectural style and significant features, including the murals and decorations have not been significantly changed.
The Bagdad Theatre, Portland, Oregon, 1927. Image courtesy of Oregon Historical Society.The theater’s Grand Opening was a major celebration in the Hawthorne area, with dancing, music, and even searchlights to draw attention to the area4. Another major point that drew audiences to the theater was the advertisement of the musical performers and orchestra. The orchestra was led by Leon Strashin, who was previously the concert master for the Metropolitan Grand Opera, and the director of music for theaters in San Francisco and Los Angeles5. Additionally, the theater advertised their organist, Miss Helen Ernest playing on a Kimball to accompany the films6. Other performers for the opening program included the San Su Strutters (a jazz orchestra), the Portland male quartet, and Marilyn Mills and her horse Beverly7. The film Her Big Night (1926), staring Laura LaPlante, was on the opening night program through the following Tuesday night and was used as a majoring advertising point8. 

      
            The theater has hosted two significant film premieres, the first being One Flew Over the Cuckoo’s Nest (1975) which was attended by the cast, including Jack Nickolson. It was filmed in nearby Salem and the premiere was a benefit fundraiser for the Mental Health Association of Oregon9. In 1991 the theater hosted the premiere for My Own Private Idaho (1991) attended by Keanu Reeves, River Phoenix, and director Gus Van Sant who all frequented a nearby McMenamins (who eventually bought the theater) pub during filming10.

On January 16th, 1975, the theater opened its “Backstage Theater” by renovating what was previously the stage and backstage area used by the vaudeville performers11. Around the same time the balcony was sectioned off into a separate theater room. The three-room theater remained until 1991 when brothers Mike and Brian McMenamin bought the theater after their success with the nearby Mission Theater and converted the theater back to one auditorium by removing the wall separating the balcony and changed the seating arrangements to add small tables so they could serve food in the theater12. Eventually they converted the theater behind the main screen, that was once the dressing room for the vaudeville performers into the Backstage Bar.

According to Sanborn Fire Insurance Maps, the theater space was long and narrow, measuring 34’ x 90’. It had at least 300 seats, since that number of men attended a lecture on social hygiene in the theater in 1916 (2).
The Bell Theatre, Springfield, Oregon, date unknown. Image courtesy of Springfield Historical Society.Prior to 1920, the theater was simple with none of the luxurious seats and decorations found in the larger Eugene theaters, such as the Rex. After the theater changed hands in 1917, for example, the new owner received only two motion picture projectors, chairs, and stage settings (3). The silent pictures did have piano accompaniment sometimes. Eunice Parker and Flaud Townsend were two local high school girls who were hired in 1915 and 1919, respectively, to play piano for Bell audiences. Admission ranged from 10-25¢ (4), and prices could go as high as 35-50¢ for special shows, such as traveling vaudeville troupes (5).

The Bell Theatre was a vibrant and dynamic part of the Springfield community. In addition to serials, educational shorts, feature-length films, and newsreels, the theater hosted vaudeville, live theater, music, dance, and other non-movie events such as bicycling dogs. The Bell was also a community meeting space, with political meetings, lectures, the Red Cross, the local high school band and theater group, and even election results (projected on the screen) all making use of the theater during this period.
      
            In 1915 the Bell showed a Pathé serial based on the stories of the character J. Rufus Wallingford. The print tie-in ran in the Lane County News and encouraged readers to see the story “picturized” on Tuesdays and Wednesdays at the Bell (6). The Wallingford serial ran in several other theaters throughout Oregon in 1915, which suggests that the Pathé Exchange in Portland had a distribution deal in the region.

The various owners of the Bell promoted the theater to the Springfield community in ways that were typical of exhibitors in the 1910s. Small news items and advertisements ran in the Springfield newspaper early on, and larger ads with the weekly program ran regularly by 1918, despite the Bell being the only theater in town. W.J. White installed an electric revolving device to display movie posters outside the theater (7). Owners offered coupons, provided free movie tickets for students who earned good grades, and promoted itself as a “cool place to spend a Sunday afternoon,” with its eighteen electric fans and 600 pounds of ice.

The Bell Theatre changed hands rather frequently in the 1910s, reflecting the rapid changes in and uncertainty in local movie theaters during this period.

Wallace Potter ran the Bell from 1912-1914, according to the city directory. J.J. (Joseph) Bryan took over the theater sometime in 1914-1915, but by July of 1915, Bryan sold the theater to E.F. and F.A. Rudrauff, brothers who also owned a typewriter business in Eugene. Bryan said that he wanted to devote more time to running the Folly Theatre in Eugene, in which he had recently purchased a half-interest (8).

In May 1916, the Rudrauff brothers sold the theater to W.J. White, who also ran the Arcade in Cottage Grove at that time (9). White became the manager off and on for the next few years, with the theater changing hands four times until White eventually sold the business to J.H. Peabody in 1919 (10).

The theater continued to change hands through the 1920s, and continued to show current Hollywood films. The Bell made the transition to sound in early March 1930 with a showing of THE UNTAMED, starring Joan Crawford (11), but by the next year the theater closed for good (12).",NA,"“Springfield Will Have Two More Brick Blocks,” The Eugene Guard, April 5, 1911: 6.

            The Bell Theatre was in operation at 455 Willamette St. from 1908-1911 with T.C. (Thomas) Swinney as proprietor. The theater was in a long, narrow space measuring 32’ wide and about 78’ long. It is unknown how many seats it had.

The Bell ran regular ads in the Eugene Daily Guard to promote its programming. Along with short films, the Bell hosted vaudeville with a live orchestra, and novelty acts, such as “Consul Jr. the Educated Chimpanzee.” The Bell showed a popular boxing film in April 1910, the Nelson-Wolgast fight, a one-hour show that ran continuously throughout the afternoon and evening. Admission was still the usual 10¢ for this special attraction (reduced from 25¢). T.C. Swinney even splurged on a full-page ad in the newspaper for the show.",NA,NA

In 1910 the Bijou acquired films from Amalgamated Film Exchange, and the manager was asked to advertise that he received the films from this Portland based company. Instead of mentioning it in a regular advertisement the manager at the time, A, L. Midgley, decided to put the entire letter in several March publications of the local newspaper. The Amalgamated Film Exchange boasted that they had films “approved by the board of censors.” If a theater was found to be showing unapproved films, or the uncensored versions of films, it could be fined.

The contemporary Bijou Cinema in Eugene, established in 1980, is heir to that tradition, although the two theaters aren't related to each other except in name.

Although ""bijou"""" suggests a space with ornamentation and grandiosity befitting the fantastic world of cinema, the early Bijou Theatre in Eugene was located in a plain storefront at 487 Willamette St., across the street from the much larger Eugene Theatre at 490 Willamette. One newspaper review commented on how small the stage was to accommodate a full theatrical performance. In 1902 the space held a plumbing business and a barber, and by 1912 it was a grocery store.

      
            The Bijou ran ads and placed little news items in the Eugene Daily Guard to promote its “high-class vaudeville” and “Bijouoscope” moving pictures. Admission was 10¢, twice as much as a typical nickelodeon theater during this time. There were “gold watch giveaways” to help draw in audiences. Nonetheless, the Bijou had to close in early 1905 because manager Mayo Evans couldn’t cover his operating expenses due to insufficient audience numbers. In 1906, prices went as high as 25¢, 35¢, and 50¢ for theatrical performances.",NA,NA

Exterior of the Bijou Art CinemasThe theater was at one point owned by four partners, including current owner Julie Blonshteyn, along with another theater that was being expanded in a downtown location called the Broadway Metro. Tensions grew between Blonshteyn and one partner in particular which led to a legal battle, resulting in the separation of the two businesses. Now the Bijou and the Metro are owned and operated separately.

The Bijou has been in operation since opening in 1980 and has a focus screening foreign and art films. They have a loyal base of customers but aren’t very profitable, the main drive is to screen movies for the community. The theater came about in 1980 after the original founder Michael Lamont went around town screening films for the community and his friends told him he should open a theater. The Bijou has an unassuming façade, with little more than a small banner with the name and a small marquee with movie times making their business known. The lobby is flooded by red light from the stained glass windows, there’s a courtyard in the center, and only two auditoriums.

Bligh opened his grand eponymous theater in June 1911 to a packed audience who enjoyed a full program of vaudeville, music, and moving pictures. The theater began construction a year before as half of a large and modern building in downtown Salem. The $50,000 theater was designed to accommodate an audience of 700 people with a ""commodious gallery"" and ""a stage large enough to handle almost any attraction"" including theater productions and movies (1). According to newspaper stories at the time, Bligh had arrived ""broke"" in Salem three years earlier (2). He operated a 10-cent theater in 1909 (3) and somehow bootstrapped himself into a prosperous entrepreneur. By 1917 Bligh operated three Salem theaters, including the Ye Liberty and the Grand (4).

The Bligh theater boasted all of the latest safety features of the time, including an asbestos drop curtain, all electric wiring in conduits, and ""the most perfect artificial ventilation system"" such that ""Salem people will be surprised at the size and equipment of this new temple of amusement, which surpasses anything of the kind in the state and is a fine advertisement of our city"" (5).

The Bligh theater hosted musical performances as well as frequent vaudeville performances. They often held comedy shows as well as famous orchestras.

Bligh's son and co-manager Frank Bligh decided that the Bligh theater should take part in an exploitation contest sponsored by the film periodical Universal Weekly. In the tenth week of the contest the Bligh theater was actually named as a weekly winner due to a particularly effective cooperative tie-in between the theater and Salem’s Capitol Journal newspaper (6). The paper ran a large advertisement for a “Capital [sic] Journal Matinee” at the Bligh. In the same paper was printed a cut-out coupon which could be presented at the theater to gain admission for five cents. This was targeted specifically at children, as the serial was considered to have good appeal for youngsters. The clever part about this advertising scheme is that the paper ran both the advertisement and a short two-column reader for three weeks at no cost to Bligh. This provided the Bligh theater with three weeks of free front-page advertising, increasing their patronage, while the Capitol Journal received an increase in readership due to the exclusive coupon deal with the theater.5 This advertising practice is an ideal example of a marketing tie-in between business (and even industries) that turned out to be mutually beneficial for both parties.

      
            Capitol Journal, Oct. 21, 1916, p. 7. Newspapers.com.In 1916 the Bligh screened Purity (Rea Berger, 1916), which starred the famous model Audrey Munson. The movie played all over Oregon, although it faced censorship elsewhere due to the nudity.

      
      
  
          
            Possibly, some of T.G. Bligh's success was due to a side business distributing illegal liquor out of the back of the theater, his hotel, and his own home. He was arrested in 1917 but released with a mere $25 fine as a ""warning.""
Oregon Daily Journal, Feb. 9, 1917, p. 11. Newspapers.com.T.G. Bligh was killed in an auto accident in 1924, and his son Frank assumed sole ownership of the theater.

Bligh,"Bligh's Capitol Theatre opened in Salem, Oregon in 1926 and remained open through the early 1990s. It became one of the best silent movie and vaudeville theaters in Salem. It was located at 542 State Street and owned by Frank D. Bligh. Mr. Bligh, who was from Canada, later moved to Oregon with his father in 1910.

Frank Bligh’s father, T. G. Bligh, was also a businessman who had been an owner of multiple theaters and hotels, including the Bligh theater prior to his death. “Thomas Gregor Bligh came to Salem from Vancouver, BC, in 1910, practically penniless. At the time of his death, he was making ready to open the new Salem Hotel at High and Ferry as well as making plans for a large opera house, theater, and business block on the site of the old Salem hotel at High and State” (1). 

When T.G. Bligh passed away in 1924, Frank Bligh purchased the building and opened the theater with the new name. Bligh's Capitol Theatre opened to the public on October 5, 1926. Approximately 10,000 people came to the opening to tour the new theater. Guests were not charged an entrance fee for opening night (3).

The theater was decorated using a mix of orange and green colors, with terra cotta architecture and Florentine-style interior. The dome-shaped, stained-glass marquee was one of the theater's most beautiful features, as it was a miniature version of the state Capitol dome.

            Other features included two glass rooms. One room was a smoking room, and another was called the crying room. These separate rooms allowed guests to continue to watch shows while either smoking or caring for their children. The theater also had its own organ. ""The $25,000 Wurlitzer organ was built with its own elevator, allowing it to be raised and lowered from view of the audience"" (7). 

Bligh's Capitol Theatre hosted a variety of entertainment options, including vaudeville shows, silent movies, live plays, and talking movies. In the 1940s, Warner Brothers operated the theater. By the 1950s, the theater primarily only showed second-run movies. The theater used several different ways to promote activities, including newspaper advertisements, charity events, and contests that included large prizes such as trips to Hollywood (6).

            Daily Capitol Journal, Nov. 13, 1926, p. 11. Newspapers.com.The theater used a variety of promotional strategies, but the main one was the use of contests and prizes. By using contests the theater was able to interact with the community. One ad for a Hollywood screen test is above.

According to the Sanborn Fire Map, some of the other companies surrounding the Capitol Theatre included Montgomery Ward & Co, Pacific Fruit & Produce Co., Industrial Supplies, Elsinore Theatre, and several parking structures (4).

There was a fire in the theater in 1935 which caused severe damage. In 1990 when the theater closed, the last two movies shown were “Total Recall” and “Back to the Future III.” The Capitol Theatre was ultimately torn down in April 2000 because of too much structure decay. The site is now a parking lot.",NA,"“Auto Smashup Fatal to Two.” The Oregon Statesman, 4 Nov. 1924, p.1.

According to the Corvallis Gazette-Times, the building was very fire proof, with walls of concrete and brick and a metal ceiling. The projection booth was constructed of hollow tiles and had an automatic fire door. An engineer at Oregon State College (later Oregon State University) designed the ventilation system, which reportedly refreshed the theater's air every four minutes. In the summer the air was forced through running water before it entered the theater in order to cool it and to be ""thoroughly cleansed of all impurities [as] it enters fresh and cool"" (3).

While the Blue Mouse was under construction, manager Sidney Trask claimed that he planned to run a “somewhat different theatre,” proposing to show “only the best pictures.” Prior the opening show, the well known and beloved Portland Organ played a musical program intended to showcase all the possibilities of the new theater (4).
      
            The Blue Mouse theater of Corvallis was created as a copy of the famous Blue Mouse in Seattle, Washington. It was described as having a cozy, comfortable atmosphere, but also used hired ushers to add a sense of importance and prestige (see below).
Corvallis Gazette-Times, Sept. 1, 1921, p. 7.

Corp. (owner), Hamrick-Evergreen (owner), Herbert Sobottka (manager)","After buying out The Globe theater in October of 1921, owner John Hamrick closed it down to change it to a “first-class first-run show” theater (1). The Globe would soon become the Blue Mouse -- named after another one of Hamrick’s successful theaters in Seattle, WA -- and would go under a $30,000 dollar remodel (roughly $450,000 dollars today) changing the seats, seating arrangement, and entrance to the theater (1). After construction, the theater reopened as the new Blue Mouse on November 28th, 1921, premiering William Fox’s Queen of Sheba for its big opening night (2). 
Moving Picture World Journal, November 5th, 1921, p.110After its grand opening, the Blue Mouse theater was fairly successful, as one of the big downtown theaters filmgoers could attend. Throughout the 1920s Hamrick made sure to make the theater known, as several promotional advertisements for different films showing at the theater were in The Oregon Daily Journal and even the Film Daily. Some of the advertisements would take up a whole page, such as the one for the film A Sailor-Made Man (3). Others would even take up two full columns within newspapers, such as the one for Where Is My Wandering Boy Tonight (4).

      
            Other interesting promotions the theater had were free matinee tickets and cash prizes. In September of 1922, an advertisement for the film A Tailor-Made Man appeared in The Oregon Daily Journal, illustrating how to get a free ticket for a matinee showing at the Blue Mouse theater (5). To get the ticket, one would need to bring in a ‘want ad’ or ‘classified cash ad’ to The Oregon Daily Journal on the verified days, and the ad would come with your free ticket (5). A few months later, Hamrick himself would hold a singing contest at the Blue Mouse for a cash prize, where patrons of the theater could vote upon their favorite contestants through an admission ticket (6). According to the article, the competition is only open to, “bona fide vocalists,” where the first-place prize would be $500 dollars, second place $250, third $150 and fourth $100 (6).
The Oregon Daily Journal, September 28th, 1922, p.19 After 1922 -- though the theater remained under the ownership of John Hamrick for some time -- Blue Mouse went through several managers, switching between local theaters. Fred Teufel, manager of Blue Mouse would switch with Al Raleigh in 1923 (7). However, there are still some inconsistencies with exact dates and changes in management due to finding Fred Teufel’s name listed in the 1925 Film Daily Year Book as the manager for Portland’s Blue Mouse (8). There are other discrepancies with the timeline of theater owners for the theater, such as an article from the Film Daily stating the theaters ownership getting transferred to the Ranier Theas. Corporation in 1935 (9). Though, around 1938, an article from the Motion Picture Herald indicates that the owners Hamrick-Evergreen of Blue Mouse would be closing the theater (10). Hamrick-Evergreen would reopen the theater once more in 1939 as a newsreel theater, which would also be the last article that mentions the theater in much depth (11).","John Hamrick, the original owner, owned several theaters throughout the Pacific Northwest during the 1920s-1940s, Hamrick was known to decrease his theater prices during the summer season to attempt to increase ticket sales (going from 50 cents for evening showings to 35 cents), In the late 1930s, John Hamrick teams up to form Hamrick-Evergreen Co.","1.

John Hamrick was the managing director of the theater, and he chose to open the new movie house with Grandma's Boy featuring Harold Lloyd which was a 5 part comedy, and claimed, ""Each scene a scream, each bit a hit, each reel a riot."" 
Flier for opening night Aug. 12, 1922. Puget Sound Pipeline.The Blue Mouse Theater was very popular and seemed like it was going to be a success, but in 1922 just four months after the theater opened, a fire on December 7 wiped out over 200 businesses within 30 blocks of downtown Astoria, and the Blue Mouse was one of the buildings claimed. 
1922 fire in downtown Astoria. Clatsop County Historical Society, Oregon.Along with the Blue Mouse, other theaters including the Star, Liberty and Astoria theaters were all destroyed. This took out most of the play houses in the city, and three of them were owned by John Hamrick. With Christmas approaching so soon after the fire Hamrick was determined to re-open the Blue Mouse by December 25, 1922 as a gift to the people of Astoria.

Hamrick returned to Astoria from business in Seattle to smoldering streets and the ruins of his three theaters, and this is when he told Mayor Bremner he would have a new theater by Christmas Day. His first move was securing a lease in the Lovell building on the corner of 14th and Exchange streets. 
The Lovell building can be seen in the back left as one of the only remaining structures on the block, and where the Blue Mouse Theater would be re-opened. Fort George Brewery p. 2.Hamrick worked day and night with electricians, carpenters, and painters. He brings chairs in from Portland and a Photoplayer organ and Gardiner screen from Seattle as well as other equipment. On Christmas Day the, now only, theater opened with Mary Pickford's ""Tess of the Storm Country"" which Hamrick charged lower prices than had ever been charged for a first run of this film, 10 cents. In comparison, the same movie opened at the Blue Mouse Theater in Portland on the same day for 75 cents. 

 

      
            The new Blue Mouse Theater was the only one at the time, but it was a marvelous Christmas present to the still recovering citizens of Astoria who had lost so much just weeks before. Hamrick sacrificed being at the Blue Mouse Theater in Seattle with his family in order to be in Astoria and complete this project on time, but he claims it was worth the sacrifice if it meant bringing joy and entertainment to the city of Astoria.

Jackey who installed a lot of the equipment, A.E. Woersel who installed the organ, Art Hile who was the resident manager and his assistant, H.R. Resner. There were also the architect, C.T. Diamond, and, of course, the organist, George Nykliciek. After the fire, Nykliciek was offered a big position at a theater in San Francisco, but he refused the offer and got another job in Astoria while he waited for Hamrick to finish the Blue Mouse so the he could go back to working for Hamrick.

Woersel of Sherman Clay and Co.The Lovell building was originally built in 1921, and following the fire it became the cultural hub for the city housing an arcade, the Blue Mouse Theater, and varying businesses throughout the year. The building remained a garage as an automotive dealership and repair facility until the late 1990s. After this, the building was abandoned for a period of time, and now it is home to a bakery and brewery and pub house, continuing its legacy as an entertainment and culture hub for the city of Astoria.

It was created by Bob White, a World War I Navy veteran, and a local showman who was very much associated with the Multnomah theaters in suburban Portland at the time. He operated 17 theaters in the Metro area. Lee Arden Thomas was the architect of the building, and he created a 712 seat theatre that later became a multiuser space. The Bob White began with silent films in 1924 when they opened with Beau Brummel starring John Barrymore.
The Bob White Theatre, Portland, Oregon, 1924. Image courtesy of Nick Haas.Bob White got the assistance B.F. Shearer Inc. when creating his theatre as this company was known for decorating and equipping some of the finest movie theaters up to this point in history. Since The Bob White was opening in a residential area, seven miles from the chaos of the business center of the city, Mr. White and Mr. Shearer wanted to continue with the family friendly and unique ideas. This led to the creation of two rooms that helped bring patrons in-a smoking room and a crying room. This accommodated working folks who often smoked in their times of relaxation as well as mothers with young kids. This was a major selling feature for the Bob White, and these rooms added to the success of the theatre overall. 
Exhibitors Herald, June 21, 1924, p. XXIII. Lantern Media History Digital Library.By 1930 the theatre ran its first fully sounded film, and by the 1940s they were showing films such as The Cowboy and the Blonde and The Gay Vegabond. The Bob White also used different promotional strategies, one of which targeted ""ladies"" saying they would receive a ""beautiful dish"" just for attending the theatre on specified days. 
The Bob White Theatre, Portland, Oregon, 1924. Image courtesy of Nick Haas.Though the theatre was considered unusual because of their innovative thinking at the time, The Bob White's ability to create a neighborly atmosphere through the incorporation of smoking and crying rooms as well as promotional strategies that focused on women were major factors in the success of the theatre. 

      
            The theatre was successful and operated well until the early 1970s when it went dark. It was briefly revived as an Asian chop-socky house were martial arts films were shown, and then it also went through a period of showing Spanish-language films. This lasted into the mid-80s until the theatre was renamed as The Arleta Theatre, but it ultimately closed as a theatre later that year. In 1986, Dave Haskin purchased the building as a personal residence where he housed pipe organs and artifacts. It was closed to the public. 

Flash forward to 2009, Haskin passed away, and in 2012 Nick Storie purchased the theatre for $350,000.

Image courtesy of Benjamin Brink/The Oregonian.Storie tried to revive the space for events such as raves, but he ultimately fell flat and wanted to sell to Nick Haas, one of his much younger co-workers, in 2014. Haas tried to gather money from different investors so that he could create a more functional theatre and restore the original ideals and wonder of The Bob White Theatre. He put as much time and money into the theatre as possible, but the sale fell through, and the theatre ceased to exist.

Beginning with the creation of the theatre in a residential area instead of the business center of Portland, followed by the addition of smoking and crying rooms to appeal to more families and average working class people. The Bob White focused on their patrons and ran for so many years because it was an accommodating and welcoming atmosphere for the average American looking for entertainment and comfort. ","Opened in a residential area, The Arleta, Featured smoking and crying rooms, Ranked as the most beautiful suburban theater in Portland when opened, Tickets: 5-10 cents","Sanborn Maps, Portland 1924-1928 vol. 3, 1924, Sheet 360.

Bungalow,"215 E St., North Powder, Oregon","North Powder, OR",45° 1.81667' N,117° 55.30000' W,1912-10-01,1912,1929-07-01,1929,unknown,"J.C. Weskel, Paul Dahlstrom, Norval G. Olson, Mr. Haynes","It's not clear when the Bungalow opened. It is listed on the vaudeville circuit in a national trade publication in 1912, and is listed in the 1914-1915 directory of U.S. motion pictures theaters.

Sanborn Fire insurance maps only exist for North Powder from 1910 and 1930. The Bungalow theater never appears on any of them, indicating that it did not exist long enough to be included in the surveys. As such, an exact location of the Bungalow Theater cannot be easily determined. It is likely that it was located in the central downtown area, near city hall, the post office, and several other businesses. One possibility is the Dance Hall on 2nd and D street.

Interestingly, during the theater’s short history it passed hands through several managers. We don’t have specific information about the theater’s profitability, but it is possible that each manager struggled to capitalize on North Bend’s small population and make the theater financially viable.

The Bungalow theater only promoted itself within the small community. It regularly placed advertisements within the local newspaper, North Powder News. These advertisements informed readers of upcoming shows, including information about the studio, actors that were included, and a brief plot synopsis.
North Powder News, Sept. 7, 1923, p. 8. 

      
            Manager/owner Paul Dahlstrom sent local reviews of movies to the national trade industry journal, Exhibitors' Herald, which tells us something about the programming at the Bungalow as well as how local audiences responded to those movies.

            The University of Oregon Libraries hold microfilm copies of North Powder News from 1917-1938, which may contain further information about the theater’s promotional strategies, as well as its general history.

In July of 1929, the Bungalow theater was wired to exhibit motion pictures with sound. Olson bragged that his theater was the only small-town theater to be equipped for talkies. It is unlikely that this statement is entirely true, and this is likely a bit of self-promotion. However it is certainly noteworthy that as early as 1929 a town as small as North Powder was equipped for sound exhibition.
Motion Picture News, June 22, 1929, p. 2220. Media History Digital Library. 

      
            Tragically, it was only later that same year that  the Bungalow theater was destroyed in a fire. The total value of all the theater equipment was $10,000 ($144,250.87 in 2018 dollars). This information appeared the the nationally published Motion Picture News, which incorrectly stated that the Bungalow was located in La Grande instead of North Powder. This is likely due to La Grande’s prominence as a major city along Eastern Oregon’s railroads, whereas North Powder would be less likely to be known by a national publisher.
Motion Picture News, July 13, 1929, p. 225. Media History Digital LibraryHowever, other trade journals such as The Film Daily correctly list the Bungalow Theater’s location in North Powder. After the theater burned down, the owners chose to keep it permanently closed. In 2018, there remains zero movie theaters in North Powder. Residents’ only option for theater exhibition is to drive to either La Grande or Baker City.

Burnside Theater,"NW 5th & W. Burnside Street, Portland, Oregon","Portland, OR",45° 31.38333' N,122° 40.50000' W,1914-11-15,1914,1931-01-01,1931,500,"A.C. Ruby, George M. Harris, The Portland Amusement Company, D. Solis Cohen Jr., Tony C. Ziccardi","Although its opening date is still to be determined, the Burnside theater was anticipated within the news for several months before and during the building’s construction. Investor and owner A.C. Ruby spent roughly $50,000 (which is equal to about $1.2 million today) on constructing the three-story building, which would be built to include a few storefronts, as well as a hotel with 64 rooms above the would-be theater (1).
Morning Oregonian, May 3rd, 1914, p.12. Historic Oregon NewspapersBy November of 1914, the building had been completed, but the initial opening night for the Burnside theater is unclear; after news of its completion, the first time the theater gets mentioned in the Morning Oregonian and the Oregon Daily Journal is in December of 1914 for a Christmas benefit showcase (see ‘Promotional Strategies’ and ‘Programming’ under the Research section of this site) (2).

From the research currently gathered, general programming for the theater was like most during this time in the nineteen-teens, such as being one of several theaters listed in an ad for the 1914 motion-picture showcase of Exploits for Elaine (3). Popular showcases such as this one seem to be common for the theater so far, as in 1919 a similar ad for the motion-picture showcase of Bound & Gagged contained the theater in its listings (4).

      
            Though information on the programming and promotion of the theater is rather scarce, there were a few interesting articles on the owners and managers of the theater. Found in the Oregon Daily Journal, George M. Harris -- the manager of the theater at the time -- was arrested for overcrowding the theater, allowing patrons to stand and crowd in the aisles which resulted in a major fire hazard and warrants for his arrest (5). In the end, Harris pleaded ‘not guilty’ and paid a fine of $25 (roughly $500 today). Prior to this event, Harris was also involved in a censorship controversy with the board of censors in July of 1915. The issue was primarily a “misunderstanding,” according to the article, where Harris had shown films that were created by ex-bandits George Sontag and Chris Evane, but was luckily let off with a warning (6).
The Oregon Daily Journal, February 14th, 1916, p.9. Newspapers.comShortly after Harris’s incident involving the fire hazard and his near arrest, the Portland Amusement Company -- founded by H.C. Stevens -- took on the lease for the Burnside theater (7). Unfortunately, much after 1916, there are a few discrepancies in regards to the theater and its historical timeline. With very little ads and major gaps between managers and dates, it is still undetermined what precisely was often shown at the theater, and who was running it. According to the Portland city directory in 1931 (the final time the theater is mentioned in the city’s directory after this date), the final manager was Tony C. Ziccardi (8). Whether he was a manager under the ownership of the Portland Amusement Company is still uncertain; however, it instils a rough concept as to when the theater was no-longer up and running.

Capitol Theater,"1023 Wall St., Bend, Oregon","Bend, OR",44° 3.60000' N,121° 18.80000' W,1923-01-25,1923,1959-05-22,1959,642,"Owner - D. T. Carmody, Mgr - Byron A Stover","Capitol Theater Grand Opening, 1923 (Cinema Treasures)The Capitol Theater, on the corner of Wall and Newport first opened its doors on January 24th, 1923. Originally, the grand opening was set for the week of Christmas, which was about a month and a half prior, however, due to weather and other reasons the date kept getting pushed about a month and a half further. (1 & 2)

During its first years, the theater contained a Wurlitzer organ, two Simplex projectors, a fireproof projecting room, heating and air conditioning. The venue represented an overall investment of more than $50,000, which would now be worth more than $767,770 according to the CPI Inflation Calculator. (3)

On opening night, the Capitol Theater was a full house and hundreds of patrons were turned away due to maximum capacity seating, which amounted to 642. Owner, D. Carmody disclosed that the theater was ""conceived, built and financed by local citizens"" in Bend. (4)

Manager, Claude Kelley signed a contract with the Famous Players Lasky corporation for Paramount releases in 1923. (5)

Following Kelley, new manager, Byron Stover, secured an agreement with the International News Service to screen news pictures twice a week. The pictures focused on news events of the week and were sent straight from Portland. (6)

In September of 1924, a fire started in the basement when cord wood was placed too close to the furnace. The fire was contained, however, most damage was to The Pine Tree, which was a small concessions stand within the venue, as well as the basement. According to Carmody, costs didn't exceed more than a few hundred dollars. (7)

The Capitol tried to incorporate a concessions stand called The Pine Tree, which lasted about a year and a half, but deemed it unsuccessful. Instead, they renovated it into a new office space. (8)

Due to cold weather, the theater would occasionally close down until the furnace could offset the chilling temperatures. (9)

For renovation and the addition of sound equipment, the theater closed down for a month and reopened in September of 1935. (10) A year and a half later, the theater began installing a mirrorphonic sound system, replacing the former sound equipment that produced ""flat sounds."" (11)

In December of 1939, an employee was injured when attempting to put Christmas decorations on the Capitol marquee that was located on top of the roof, in front of the theater. The marquee gave way, hurling the worker to the sidewalk below, giving him minor injuries. Fire Chief, Tom Carlon disclaimed that the high winds continuously weakened the structure. This caused a need for an overall inspection of street marquees in downtown Bend to ensure that they are safe before the snowfall season hit, which can add tremendous amounts of weight on buildings and structures. (12)

An armed robber held up a Capitol cashier and escaped with about $400 in change. This occurred during a Sunday evening show. The robber disguised himself by wearing tape over his face and bleed by a nearby parked getaway car. (13)

The theater was demolished to make way for new structures in May of 1959. The marquee was removed first and saved. (14)

Hanley, Owner: Mike Goldstein","The Casino Theater opened on July 14th, 1912. It was located on 4th & Burnside streets in Portland, Oregon. The very small theater was situated inside the Hotel Philip, which is now known as the Grove Hotel and still exists today. However, it was in October of 1930 that the city of Portland decided to widen Burnside street, forcing Hotel Philip to scale back their building's size by almost 20 feet, demolishing the Casino Theater all together. In the photo listed below the Casino Theater is clearly seen nestled into the Hotel Philip. Sadly, the photo in the right column depicts the very same street and hotel two years later after the demolition/remodel and the loss of the Casino Theater (5).
Casino Theater and Hotel Philip, Portland Oregon,1928. Image Courtesy of Portland Archives.The Casino was very small and relied mostly on the patrons of the hotel for business than anything else. There were little to no advertisements published in the newspaper promoting the theater or any high class acts to be shown. There was one small fragment of an article found in The Sunday Oregonian that discussed a musical comedy known as ""Tangerine."" It was shown in another theater known as the Savoy as well as Asbury Park before making a short appearance at the Casino. Not much else is known about the shows, acts, or films played at the Casino but speculation suggests that most often times they were small, local productions similar to the ""Tangerine""(4).

      
            An unexpected aspect of the theater was its- what appeared to be, extreme struggle with crime. In July of 1919 the Casino's safe was stolen by robbers and was never recovered. It was a loss of $437, which today is equal to around $6,500. That was a significant amount of money for the time and would have detrimental to the theater's finances. It was also written in the report that a jewelry store on the same block as well as several other shops were robbed the same night, with the jewelers losing $300. According to the article, a ""wave of crime"" had been sweeping the area and the police were ""helpless"" (2).

First opening in 1920, the Castle Theater was a mid-range set price theater that often played traveling films. Other forms of entertainment often included in the theater's atmosphere included bands that would perform in the main atrium to entertain people in between showings. While in operation, the main promotional strategy that Castle Theater used was to advertise in ways like promoting the feature film and giving a synopsis of the show in order to entice people to visit the theater. As seen in the photos below, the advertisement for the Castle theater can be seen promoting a film featuring Norma Talmadge and Eugene O'Brian's ""The Voice from the Minaret"" along with critics' opinions and a hook for the film1. Other advertisements depict the Castle Theater advertising themselves based on their sales tactics, such as setting a fixed price so that there was never a question of whether you could afford it, with evening shows being set at thirty cents per person, and matinees being twenty cents per person2. Although the Castle theater was technically in operation from 1920 to 1925, the property of Castle theater was sold while the theater remained on a lease with the property. After closing, the theater became home to the Bank of Commerce and eventually a Miller's Department Store, but in the 1970's the city of Eugene sold the property to be paved into a parking lot.",NA,"1.

Stephens, Colonel G. T. Woodlaw","The Circle Theater opened December 2nd, 1912 on the corner of 4th and Washington street. According to the Moving Picture World journal it housed up to 900 seats and brandished exciting new ways of combating fires- a common fear theaters at the time often faced. The theater featured a new ventilation system and concealed its lighting in order to keep the air clean and decrease the chances of any sparks catching.
The Circle Theater, Portland Oregon,1964. Image courtesy of Portland Archives. The Circle had been built with beautiful craftsmanship and was not only a place to see movies but one of a social gathering or vogue parties (1). Their business was proud to flaunt their ownership of a hidden $5,000 organ and live orchestras that accompanied the silent films each showing. The theater even kept a musical staff on hand to direct and oversee the music that was played with each movie. According to an article published in 1922, these musicians were in charge of directing the audiences emotions and thoughts throughout a viewing and even created sound affects(2). This was one factor that potentially even influenced customers to come to this particular theater due to its high caliber of musicians and their capacity for modern and classical pieces (3).

Over the course of its 52 year long career The Circle changed management three times. For the first two years of operation the theater was overseen by a Mr. C.J. Kerr. It is unclear when or why his position was switched over to a man named G.T. Holtzclaw sometime late in the year 1913 or early 1914. Holtzclaw went on the run the theater until April of 1920, when the franchise was purchased by Colonel G.T. Woodlaw. An article written about Woodlaw's acquisition explains that for the last eight years the theater ran under the jurisdiction of the Circle Amusement Company (CAC), a foundation that both Kerr and Holtzclaw had worked for during their time as managers. As it turns out was exactly the work of the CAC that was causing difficulty of the theater and what eventually prompted Woodlaw to buy (1,4,5).

      
            The theater attracted a wide variety of audiences due to its affordable prices and access to highly sought after films at the times of their release. Admission typically ranged from between 5 to 15 cents depending on the picture, time of day, and varied by age. One significant difference that set the Circle theater apart from its competitors were its hours of operation as well as their incredibly fast turn over of programs. After its last management change the theater started staying open from 9am until 4am the following morning, a rare practice for theaters at this time (7). 
The Circle Theater, Portland Oregon, date unknown. Image courtesy of cinema treasures.They often advertised their programs in newspapers which documented each act that would be performing each day of the week (Monday-Sunday)(6). While the theater mostly focused on motion pictures and largely recognized names of famous actors of the time, the Circle Theater also showcase many comedians and even vaudeville. Some popular names and shows included but are not limited to: Vin Comedy, J. Rufus Wallingford, Ruth Roland, George Orly, Douglas Fairbanks, Fatty Arbuckle, and most famously- Charlie Chaplin (8-12). Charlie Chaplin was extraordinarily well known at this time for his success in vaudeville and it would have been the show to see when he came to town July 28-29 of 1918 (12). Another popular theater item upon its release that screen in The Circle was the American film serial: ""Exploits of Elaine,"" which tells the story of a Damsel in Distress and her perilous adventures. The Circle Theater was listed as the best place to see ""Exploits of Elaine"" in Oregon at the time because of its comforting atmosphere, well ventilated air, and roomy seating (13).

Among other interesting aspects of the Circle Theater was its presence in the LGBT community. According the the 1999 Portland Gay History Walking Tour the Circle Theater was a popular place for gay men to socialize and meet in peace without being harassed or worse; arrested (14).

Unfortunately you would not be able to visit this theater on the Gay History Tour today as it was demolished on July 17th, 1964 along with all the other buildings on the block, from the corner of Washington & Fourth to Alder & Fourth (15).  ","5-15 Cent Admission, Changed ownership sometime between 1913-14 and once again in April of 1920, Only one screen, Demolished in 1964, A noted location in the Portland gay history walking tour","1.

Motion pictures, vaudeville and other acts were all parts of the amusement visitors would be able to enjoy at the theater; the following work wanted ad shows the Clinton Street Theater seeking out acts. Building at 808 1/2 Clinton Street began in the 1914s; in the spring of 1915, The Clinton Street Theater was open to the public with Ed Soderstrom as the manager of the theater. Throughout the theater's long history, the Clinton Street Theater has experienced new names, new managers and other changes although through all of it's changes the theater still remains in the same original location with an intimate single screen venue with the capacity for 222 patrons.
The Oregon Daily Journal, March 23, 1919, p. 20, Oregon Historic Newspapers.From an article in The Morning Oregonian on February 1st of 1917, it shows that the theater got off to a rather quick as being in the public's spotlight. Two boys, Charles Cain and Irvin Campbell, were arrested a the Clinton Street Theater during a showing of a film due to firing ""torpedos"" during a pistol duel on the screen. This was a major shock to the crowd, making women scream and patrons flee from the theater. Due to this occurring during the silent era of films, the crowd was not use to the noise which caused the chaos. Ed Soderstrom, the manager of the Clinton Street Theater, was present at the court hearing for the two boys and made sure that the boys would apologize to the crowd. In the article, it is addressed that Soderstrom made the boys come back to the theater two nights in a row to apologize to the crowd where he would highly advertise the occasion. This event, which was seen to startle the crowd still ended up bringing lots more patrons to the apology for the two boys mischievous acts.

Serials, which are similar to modern day television shows, were something that brought masses to the Clinton Street Theater. From The Morning Oregonian, Exploits of Elaine the series is advertised to be played at the Clinton Street Theater. Exploits of Elaine was a 1914 American film serial that was vastly popular around the nation. Serials were very important to the Clinton due to bringing audiences in every week when the episodes would come out to the public. Most all of the public would fill the theaters every nights of the weekends waiting to see their favorite pictures.
The Morning Oregonian, February 3rd, 1915, p.14, Oregon Historic Newspapers. 

      
            The Clinton Street Theater went under a change of management during the year 1919. In an article from The Morning Oregonian, it states that E.J. Potter and T.L. Monteith will be taking over the management from Ed Soderstrom due to Soderstrom leaving the city of Portland. The theater was closed for a chunk of time due to Soderstroms departure from Portland. One of the things that the article made sure to include was that even though there was going to be new management, serials would still continue to play in the theater. This short little article shows how important the serials were to both the theater and the public; because of the crowds and attention the theater was receiving from the showings of The Exploits of Elaine and other serials, such as Elmo, the Mighty and The Great Radium Mystery, it was evident that the theater needed to keep showing these pictures to keep the public coming in masses.
The Morning Oregonian, November 9th, 1919, p. 4, Oregon Historic Newspapers.Promotion strategies were a very important aspect for the management at the Clinton Street Theater. In an article from The Sunday Oregonian it addresses E.J. Potter and two of his different promotional strategies that turned out to work extremely well for the Clinton. Due to the timing of this article, right before Thanksgiving, it is stated that E.J. Potter would be outside of the Clinton Street Theater giving away turkeys to patrons who had purchased tickets to the theater. This is something that both shows the social reputation the theater was trying to give off as well as the promotional strategy to get more and more admission to the theater. Along with this strategy, another strategy was given by Potter; Potter explained in the article that he had been having nights of the week where children had free admission to the theater. Potter is quoted in the article saying ""A rather unusual discovery I made on some of the 'kiddies free' entertainments, is the fact that more grown-ups were numbered in the audiences when the children came free than on many occasions when there was no such arrangement."" This strategy proved to be a huge success for Potter and the Clinton Street Theater as they were able to make even more money than usual just by allowing children to be admitted for free.
The Sunday Oregonian, November 23, 1919, p. 4, Oregon Historic Newspapers.Today, the Clinton Street Theater is still in its original location. The theaters most noteworthy fact that the Clinton has been showing The Rocky Horror Picture Show weekly since 1978, making it one of the longest running movies in the world. The theater is proud to have not changed locations, nor many other things about the theater. Besides new owners and other management coming into the theater, the building and everything about the theater has been kept in great shape and continues to show pictures to date. The Clinton Street Theater is one of Portland's most historic theaters and a place that is worth the visit to be a part of Portland's history.","Known as The Clinton Street Theater from 1915-1944, Known as the 26th Avenue Theatre from 1945-1968, Known as the Encore from 1969-1975, Reverted to the original name, The Clinton Street Theater, in 1969 and is still in business today in the same original location","1917 Portland Oregon City Directory, Paulson Reading Room, Knight Library University of Oregon.

Leiter (Mrs. Other Clarke Leiter), Francis A. Greulich, Ed H. Ford, People's Amusement Co.","Original owners of the Colonial, S.A. Gardiner and his wife, Madlin, sold the business to J.D. Meyers and Mrs. H.B. Leiter in April 1917.

The owners of La Grande’s other major theaters, the Arcade and the Star, took significant steps to restrict the successful operation of any competitors. Meyers and Leiter had formed The People’s Amusement Company, which is perhaps one of the earliest examples of a media conglomerate. The company coordinated the motion pictures that were screened at its various theaters in order to limit competition within its own properties, while still competing with theaters owned by other individuals. In February of 1917, they took legal action against the Colonial theater, which at that point had been managed by S.A. Gardinier and his wife. The suit claimed that they had entered into an agreement with Meyers and Leiter to refrain from operating the theater until February 1918.

There is little information published about the specifics of this lawsuit, but it appears to have been resolved just a few months later–with Meyers and Leiter securing full control of the Colonial.

For much of the 1920s, the three major theaters operating within La Grande were the Arcade, the Star, and the Colonial. All three were under the control of The People’s Amusement Company.

            During the 1920s, nearly every issue of the La Grande Evening Observer contained a large advertisement for current screenings at the Colonial. These ads typically appeared alongside promotional information for the Arcade and the Star theaters as well. The common management of the three theaters enabled coordination among the programming and promotion, so that the three theaters did not necessarily directly compete with one another.

            On Tuesday, September 29th in 1925, the day before the Colonial Theater was opened, the Eugene Guard prominently highlighted the upcoming launch of the cinema house in their newspaper articles. In this specific article, the paper discusses the new theater as a “colonial and hospitably arranged” space that claims to be one of the finest suburban picture houses in the west. According to article content, the Colonial is set apart from its competition of theaters because of the modern aspects it has to offer. This includes modernity in terms of equipment, arrangement, management, as well as location seeing as how the theater is located on the eastern side of the city. This location grants easy access for university students and faculty allowing for a higher possibility of filling the 600 theater seats. I also found it interesting how this theater adds new features to theaters in Eugene including a smoking room as well as an annex. These rooms are enclosed in glass which I believe adds to the modern aesthetic the theater intends to accomplish. The announced opening screening will be the ‘Seven Days’ film. The movie is a drama comedy film which I think would be a good genre to start with because there will most likely be something for different audience preferences. More clippings from this newspaper page can be found in the Image Gallery below, and they provide some context for this article’s information. The news page contributes an acknowledgement to groups and organizations who played important parts in the opening of the theater such as Olds Wortman & King Interior Decorating Department, Stein Bros. General Contractors and Builders, Eugene Gravel Roofing Co., and the Bailey Electric company. However, there is also promotion for services located near the theater such as University Tailors, Hiltibrand’s Grocery, and more. Grouping these different ads together and associating them with the Colonial theater is a great idea because this will improve popularity and success for both the theater and the businesses.

      
      
  
          
            Apart from movie exhibitions, the Colonial Theater also held and hosted other types of events. According to the Eugene Guard newspaper, on Friday May 31st of 1935, it was announced that Queen Eugenia the third would be selected at the Colonial Theater. Queen Eugenia was some sort of pageantry competition for the city of Eugene and the Colonial Theater would hold the public crowning for the winning individual chosen from six contestants. The winner would be selected by a vaudeville program arranged by the Junior chamber of commerce, in charge of Eugene’s participation at a Rose Festival in Portland where the winner would go on to represent the city. Before the winner was selected, a parade was held that went through part of the city and would end at the Colonial theater. The parade included the candidates riding in cars, Junior chamber members, as well as the Eugene high school band. In selecting this event to be held at the Colonial theater strongly implies that the theater was a popular place for the city even into its later years of running seeing as how this occurred in May, yet it would not be under operation as the Colonial the following month of this same year. This article also demonstrates that these theater venues were not solely for the purpose of movies, they can also bring communities of people together through different sorts of events in these places for exhibition. Events like these could also encourage guests to return back on another day to view an actual film.

With over 1,200 seats the large theater was in every way extravagant. The theater was designed by two architects from Seattle, they outlined the exterior of the theater in white colored brick with over 2500 electric lights that illuminated the theater day and night.

     When one would walk down Sixth avenue they would be blown away by the architecture and the extravagance of the theater. Not only was the outside decor itself excellent, but when one would open the doors they would see the beauty held inside.  

     The interior of the building was filled with all kinds of flowers. According to one society reporter the interior of the theater “was like a veritable garden of blossoms.” The walls were covered with different paintings and the windows were draped with silk. 

     Once in the theater itself, one author wrote in the Morning Oregonian, in June 1913, that “the seats are great wide, roomy, comfy leather chairs, with plenty of room to stretch one's legs or let people pass without getting up and spilling your lap full or hat on to the floor”

Craterian,"23 S. Central Avenue, Medford, Oregon","Medford, OR",42° 19.56667' N,122° 52.28333' W,1924-10-24,1924,2022-06-21,2022,1200 (1924); 739 (current),"George A. Hunt (owner/manager), Jules B. Reisman (under Fox control), S. G. Mendenhall,  manager and publicity director","Officially opened on October 20, 1924, the 737-seat Craterian theater was primarily used to host vaudeville shows and performances. When initially built, the Craterian theater used a stucco exterior to try replicating a Spanish villa with a touch of Renaissance furnishings. The Craterian theater had different sections of its theater that appealed to different target audiences. To try appealing to men who enjoyed smoking, the Craterian theater provided a smoking lounge. Meanwhile, the Craterian theatre appealed to mothers by introducing glass-enclosed rooms to watch films in. Additionally, the Craterian theatre offered rooms for private parties, dressing rooms underneath the stage, and supposedly the West Coast's ""first hydraulic-lift organ elevator"" (Fitzgibbon). The owner, George A. Hunt, wanted the Craterian theater to be as innovative and up-to-date as possible. Hunt spent over $20,000 to be one of the very first in the city to implement Vitaphone and Movietone projectors in 1928. Film-goers were able to get admission and watch films for as low as 15 cents.

The Craterian Theater is known as a hub for entertainment and performances. Many promotional strategies were used by the Craterian Theater to try bringing in as much publicity and press to their theater. One of the biggest reasons was because of their promoter, George A. Hunt. One of his most successful promotional campaigns was hosting a naming contest for the Craterian Theater for a $25 prize. It was a massive success as it received over 1,500 submissions. Eventually, Hunt decided to choose the name ""Craterian"" based on Crater Lake. Additionally, George A. Hunt made a huge effort to keep his theater as up-to-date as possible. For example, by being the first in the city to implement the Vitaphone and Movietone projects in 1928, his movie theater was seen as newer and would attract more patrons than other theaters. Additionally, other eccentric promotional strategies such as offering a $1,000 life insurance policy against anyone frightened to death during a showing helped boost publicity and drew people in. While looking at historic newspapers in Medford, Oregon, it can be seen that newspaper advertisements were not a pivotal part of the Craterian Theater's promotional strategy. There was only one newspaper advertisement to be found. However, the Craterian Theater has been featured on quite a few newspaper articles.
Craterian Theater interior, 1925On Tuesdays, Wednesdays, and Thursdays, the Craterian Theatre put on vaudeville acts while Fridays, Saturdays, and Sundays were reserved for films. With the advent of the Vitaphone, and its installation in Hunt's Craterian Theatre in 1928, those films quickly became 'talkies' and the Craterian's programs shifted away from focusing on featuring the vaudeville acts into showing the feature films that audiences could 'see and hear.'

      
            Craterian Theatre, Medford, Oregon. Oregon Encyclopedia.During the month of October, the George Hunt Theaters Co. celebrated the anniversary of the company's incorporation with 'specialized anniversary programs'. These programs included special events such as the ones advertised for the company's 9th anniversary: ""Good Pictures, Vaudeville and Revues Will Be Offered on Anniversary Month Theater Programs"" (Medford Mail Tribune, Sept. 30, 1928, p. 6). The company took out a full page spread in the Medford Mail Tribune in order to advertise the specialized anniversary programs that the Rialto and Craterian Theaters would be presenting throughout October. This event included the ""Grand Opening of Weekly Fanchon and Marco's Stage Presentations"" held on Sunday, October 7th, 1928 along with other 'super attractions' throughout October (Medford Mail Tribune, Sept. 30, 1924, p. 6).

The theater participated in numerous events in Medford such as the parade celebrating the Armistice Day in November of 1924. The day, celebrated for the Civil War football game between Medford High School and Ashland High School, included ""special programs at the Rialto and Craterian Theaters"" (Medford Mail Tribune, Nov. 10, 1924, p. 6). The Craterian's management announced that ""All Soldiers in Uniform Are Invited Guests of the Craterian Theater Till 6:00 P.M."" during the celebrations of Armistice Day (Medford Mail Tribune, Nov. 10, 1924, p. 2).

            The Craterian theater, also known as Hunt's Craterian after owner George Hunt, spared no expense when it came to advertising its theater, often times taking up most of the newspaper page with its advertisements in a time where adding photos and designs was extremely expensive. The promotional advertisements were very stylized and never the same design twice. The advertisements often times included images depicting scenes and characters from the films being shown at the theater alongside the highest praise that the theater could offer.

Through the growth of the theater, the advertisements changed and evolved with it. For example, the logo for Hunt's Craterian evolved from simply the text into the circular bubble encapsulating ""Hunt's Craterian"" attached to each of its advertisements. Additionally, within the bubble and below the name of the theater, the location of the theater ""Central Just Off Main"" was printed in order to inform patrons where to find the theater.  With the aging of the theater and changing of different hands, the theater's logo continued to change such as in ""1928 Hunt sold his lease to Fox Theatres"" and thus the logo for the theater again transformed and became 'Fox Craterian' (Cinema Treasures). George Hunt ""bought it back in 1933 after Fox’s bankruptcy"" and, thus, the Craterian returned to being called ""Hunt's Craterian"" (Cinema Treasures).

 

      
            Craterian Theater exterior, 1925The Craterian ran regular ads in the Medford Mail Tribune, and on the theatre's first anniversary of operation, the newspaper ran an article boasting of the theatre's modernity. ""It is indeed a real pleasure for home folks to brag to visitors of the fact that nowhere on the coast is there a more up-to-date theatre than Hunt's Craterian, and then to take them to the theatre and 'show them'.""

Crystal Theatre,125 Killingsworth Ave,"Portland, OR",45° 33.76667' N,122° 40.51667' W,1911-08-16,1911,1920-10-30,1920,unknown,Frank A. Gumm,"Crystal Theatre was announced to open August 16, 1911 by “The Oregon Daily Journal” (1). Located at 125 Killingsworth Ave in Portland, Oregon seemed like a your everyday neighborhood theatre. In the advertisement of the opening, Crystal Theatre promised to be the second “Star” theater meaning that it promises to be just as “beautiful, modernly equipped and well ventilated and splendidly arranged” (1). The theatre cost about $15,000 and the manager, Frank A. Gumm. Promised to run the theater exactly along the lines of the Star theatre (1). This meant having Jean Wilson as the vocal attraction and having a wonderful musical team accompanying his performances (1). 

The theatre used many advertisements in newspapers like “The Oregon Daily Journal,” where they showed when events and performances were taking place. One advertisement from “The Oregon Daily Journal,” in 1920 had performances like “What Happened to Jones,” “The Feud,” which was a comedy and was written under the title for the community to know (2). This advertisement alone consisted of several comedy acts and it can be assumed that this was to appeal to many audiences looking for a light hearted and enjoyable act to go to. In this same newspaper publication, which was titled “Pretty Outside Suburbs Attracting Residents Who Combine City Work and Rural Life,” wrote about the Crystal Theatre and other local businesses like the J.K. Case & Son grocers, and Fryers Pharmacy, who were all working together to hold a showing of the returns of the election at the theatre (2). The Crystal theatre played a big role with other local businesses in this small, pretty outside suburb town of Portland in hosting events for the community. With numerous advertisements about the performances going on in this theatre, some being “the most thrilling pictures presented” that year, 1911, such as “The Special Messenger,” Crystal theatre was doing very well for themselves (3). Another performance included a dance by Katherine Smith, and this performance was done at the theatre for the Red Cross benefit entertainment (4). 

A Sanborn Fire Insurance Map was found for 1924 and it displayed a movie theatre in the place where the Crystal Theatre was in the 1920's. However 125 Killingsworth no longer existed on this map it could be assumed that two stores next to each other became one larger movie theatre after the Crystal theatre closed. Around this theatre there are homes, drug stores, restaurants. ",NA,"“New Films Shown at Theatre Friday,” Oregon Daily Journal, August 16, 1911: 7. Newspapers.com.

Quimby,"It is clear that the Dixie showcases more than just films in the theater. According to the Morning Oregonian from December 07, 1911, “the grand American handicap” was shown, “including the world’s best trap shot.” Because that section of the article was titled “Of Interest to Shooters,” I am assuming the target audience for the particular films and events at the theater were specific and only targeted shooters. The advertising and promotion were clear to the people reading the newspapers, allowing one to know if they would be of interest to go to that theater. According to the Morning Oregonian from January 21, 1914, the manager of the Dixie Theater was L.P. Quimby.

In the Morning Oregonian from April 21, 1913, the advertising is once again very clear to the people engaged with the newspaper. “Dixie Theater” is in bold letters and bigger font than the words surrounding it in order to catch people’s attention, specifically with people interested in entertainment. The target audience are people of all age as the article states “...entertaining to both young and old.” 

The Morning Oregonian from April 21, 1912 includes an advertisement for Dixie Theater specifically telling people not to miss a “2-reel subject shown.” From the advertisements I have seen, The Dixie theater places clear emphasis on what they can provide in terms of entertainment for their audiences. The advertisement also includes “Opp. Lipman & Wolfe’s.” Based on the location described in the National Register of Historic Places Registration Form, the Lipman & Wolfe building in Portland, Oregon was a “ten-story Commercial style building of steel skeleton frame construction…”  and was the location of the Dixie Theater.",NA,"Morning Oregonian, December 07, 1911, page 8

Rudow,"The Dream Theatre had a humble opening on Bond Street in April of 1912. Rudow & Evans Proprietors opened up the theater advertising it as “clean, comfortable, and commodious”1. Admission for the special music and films was 10 and 15 cents. An article from The Bend Bulletin states that the opening had a packed house but unfortunately the projector had some technical difficulties2. However, the proprietors followed up by stating the picture machine had been fixed and the theater is still being well attended. After one month of opening, the management installed new electrical equipment at the theater3. They installed an inductor and a high-efficiency transformer in order to ensure the best visual experience for audiences. By June of 1912, The Dream went through some architectural upgrades as it became the first building in Bend to use concrete stucco4. This added a much more modern finish to the already well-known theater.

Multiple advertisements promised moral programs, but one of the more interesting ads was for the Pathé production of The Beloved Vagabond (1915), starring Edwin Arden and Bliss Milford5. It was the first time any theater in Bend would be showing a hand-colored film. The advertisement stated, “a more life-like film has never been shown in Bend”. Admission for this showing was 15 and 25 cents.

The entrance to The Dream had a stained glass and a new box office made of glass and marble. The continuation of the article stated that the new theater would seat around 500 patrons7. It is also mentioned that a new “indirect” lighting system kept the theater from having to be completely dark while showing films. The opening at the O’Kane building for The Dream took place on December 9, 1916. The opening film was  Under Two Flags starring Theda Bara. Included in the program were local musicians and six-piece orchestra8.

Watson","Of all the early movie theaters in Eugene and Springfield, the Dreamland’s name was the most poetic. The Dreamland promised moviegoers a voyage into fantasy worlds, an escape from the workaday. The theater’s name belied its humble reality, situated as it was in a storefront space in bustling downtown Eugene.

Eugene cinema entrepreneur, Mrs. Martha E. Watson, ran the Dreamland theatre from 1908-1910 at 527 Willamette St., just a few doors down from the Hotel Smeede. The long, narrow space held 200 seats.
Hotel Smeede, 525-527 Willamette St., Eugene, c1912Mrs. Watson was the sole woman in the local movie business during this time. She was a widow with four young children to support. Fortunately, she was well off enough to simultaneously run the Dreamland and the Electric, and later the Folly and the Oregon theaters in Eugene.

      
            She owned several properties in Lane County valued at over $5,000, and was frequently mentioned in the society pages of the local newspaper. She became an active member of the Eugene Equal Suffrage League in 1912.

Little is known about the movies that played at the Dreamland, except for scant information in the Eugene Daily Guard. “Mary, Queen of Scots” played in December 1908, and “Drink,” (“film d’art”) based on the Emile Zola novel, played in November 1909. The Dreamland boasted of having a “reginaphone” for sound accompaniment in the theater, as well as “perfect” ventilation thanks to an airshaft in the ceiling.

In September 1909, Mrs. Watson had begun construction on a new brick building a few blocks south on Willamette to house her new movie theater venture, the Folly. By April of 1910, the Dreamland’s building was offered for rent, with part of the space soon to be occupied by a drug store (see the Sanborn Map below).

Martin","The Dreamland theater opened in a brick building at 6th Avenue and Main Street in Cottage Grove in the spring of 1909. Co-owners Bert Richmond and John Durham showed a combination of moving pictures, illustrated songs, and vaudeville sketches. An item in the local newspaper boasted of a new ""Edison picture machine"" and fireproof projection room.

Bert Richmond had a previous theater operating under the name ""Richmond's electric theater"" down the block, which he opened in 1908. The move to the ""fine commodious new quarters"" seems to have prompted the name change.

The Dreamland lasted only as long as the brief Oregon summer, when N.H. Martin took over ownership and quickly consolidated with the Arcade theater in the Dreamland's storefront space in October 1909, leaving Cottage Grove with only one movie theater.

Many of the sources I found just back up the previous research I conducted however I did find a little new information. The main challenges I am facing in this assignment are mainly from the lack of information known about the Dreamland. It would help if I could know the theaters before and after, but also just having more information on the different types of programs that were shown or took place there. However, maybe this information can be provided if we go more in depth into the daily lives of Albany citizens.

 

      
            I found many programs that I was not able to find before pertaining largely to the Dreamland Theater’s programming allowing me to gain a better grasp on what part the Dreamland Theater played in the lives of the residents of Albany at the time. On the opening night of the theater a tremendous amount of money was spent on interior and exterior updates. This combined with the location and previous notoriety within the city was expected to draw in a large crowd and on opening night they did just that by televising their biggest hit yet, “Forgiven”, a western comedy drama. “Forgiven”, was the first comedy drama to be shown at Dreamland after the reopening and the movie and the theater both seemed to be a hit within the city. A Sister’s Benefit took place at the theater on December 2, 1908, not too long after it had opened. At this event people were invited to watch live performances at Dreamland, in order to raise money for school in the city. I found several advertisements depicting that the theater was also commonly a well known dance hall, and the theater commonly held dances throughout the week to also draw their patrons back into the establishment.",NA,"Bibliography

Dorman (manager of Dreamland, ???-1917), Herbert Paul (manager of Dreamland, 1920)","The Dreamland Theatre was in the city of Ontario, OR and operated between roughly 1912-1930. It was a family business that resided on the mainstreet of the city. This theater was primarily operated by a man named A. I. Jaquish. He operated this establishment with the help of his daughter Dorothy who, after the death of A. I. in April of 1918,  became the sole owner and proprietor of the business. The Dreamland was managed by S.D. Dorman until 1917 and managed by Herbert Paul from this time until the closure of the theater. The building was demolished in 1937 to build a new theater, “Pix Theater,” in its place. 

This theater was built in a time when the population of the small town of Ontario, Oregon was below 2000 people. It was a single room theater that would show films daily and provided a place for the local high school to do plays. Films presented at this theater would include up to 8 reels and the price of admission ranged from fifty cents to a dollar and genres shown would range from comedy to drama. This family owned business was integral to the community. When the first sidewalks and paved roads were built outside of the theater, they were a part of the celebration. The town held a parade, a concert, and free films shown at the Dreamland.

      
            In the process of researching this theater, I found difficulty tracking down the address. There was no mention of its specific address in historical newspapers in online databases besides that it was on the ""main street"" of the town. I turned to ""Special Collections"" in the University of Oregon Library in order to find a city directory. While I did not find a directory that included dates that may have shown the Dreamland Theatre property, I did learn that there were maps of Malheur County elsewhere in the library. I scoured said maps and met the same issue, the dates of the maps were not old enough to include the theater. Finally I decided to email the Malheur County Historical Society and send a message to the Ontario, Oregon Public Library. The historical society was able to provide me with photographs of Dreamland and another theater, ""The Majestic Theatre,"" and the Public Library was able to share the addresses of both of these theaters.",NA,"""Dorothy Jaquish Will Represent Ontario at Nyssa.""

The two-story Frances Building was built to connect to the one-story Echo Theatre building in 1911 and was named after Christman’s wife, Frances. This was the first commercial structure built in the area. 

Bradt was not new to the movie theater business. He owned the Liberty Theater on Sixth Avenue and had previously owned the Rose City Theater, also on Sixth Avenue. Bradt worked as a manager for the Echo Theatre until 1921. He then became manager for the People Theater and then went into the automobile business (5). Edward Fautz took over as manager after Bradt left.

Tess, Photographer for National Register of Historic Places, Dec. 1993.Retail stores, apartments, and a public hall were also located in the Frances Building. A drug store and dry goods store were located in the building for over fifty years. Immediately across from the Echo Theatre entrance was a candy store. Additionally, there was a barbershop, apartments, and a public hall which was used for social events and meetings. The second floor of the building was used for an apartment for the theater’s manager and/or film operator. In 1930, the Frances Building became Frances Apartments, which included anywhere from four and nine apartments. 

The Echo Theatre used newspaper articles and ads for promotion material. In order to draw larger crowds, one ad from The Oregonian in 1919 states, “The whole week will be devoted to a drive for better pictures in thousands of the better theaters, big and small, all over America” and “As in the past the proof is written large in showings at more theatres,

The theater also participated in contests to draw customers. One contest being a poem contest open to children with a $300 cash prize. “In addition to this it was thought that it would stimulate wider interest if theater passes could be awarded to a great number of pupils in the schools who while not getting cash prizes, were deemed worthy of honorable mention” (10). Mr. Bradt donated theater passes as prizes.

In March 1922, Echo participated in Paramount’s 10th Anniversary celebration. Paramount seemed to resemble the best of the best in movies. Multiple Oregon theaters celebrated this anniversary. Newspaper articles inferred if your theater wasn’t showing Paramount movies, it wasn’t a great theater. Ads stated, “If it’s a Paramount Picture it’s the best show in town” (3). The theater space was also used to hold benefits (12).

Tess, Photographer for National Register of Historic Places, Dec. 1993.The Echo Theatre was very successful and a novelty in its time showing only silent movies. In 1927, due to its success, Christman partnered with Arthur Otis to form the Christman and Otis Development Company. With this partnership, they built the Bagdad Theater directly across the street from the Echo Theatre, which showed movies with sound. Because of this new and exciting theater opening, the Echo closed in 1927 and became warehouse space used for storage from 1929 to 1954. Plumbing and Electric Supply occupied the space from 1969 until 1973, when Republic Enterprises, another plumbing company, took over. In 1984, the current occupant, Echo Theater, took residence. The theater is now used for performing arts, live shows, parties, and dance classes.

C Noble, Denny Hull, Coos Bay Amusement Company, Jones Enterprises, Stan McSwain, The City of Coos Bay Urban Renewal Agency","The Egyptian Theatre opened on November 19th, 1925 in Coos Bay, Oregon (called Marshfield until 1944) in a building that was previously The Motor Inn Garage and Service Station1. The building was built in 1922 by contractor John Granstrom for Harry C. Noble and H.J. Clark2. When they built the building, they had always intended to convert it into a theater, likely when building restrictions at the time were changed1. In 1925, the building was converted by architect Lee Arden Thomas and designer Carl F. Berg for Noble and Clark to reopen as a movie theater2. When the conversion was announced the name was anticipated to be ‘The Marsden’ after one of the owners Robert Marsden, but eventually got the name The Egyptian when the themed decorations were decided upon1.
The Coos Bay Times, 11/18/1925, pg1. Newspapers.comMotor Inn Garage and Service Station. Coos Bay. Courtesy of Egyptian Theater website.The building’s conversion to a theater was a major undertaking, involving the installation of theater seating, decorating the theater in Egyptian décor, installing the projection system and organ, and hanging the Egyptian signage. The hanging flasher sign over the street cost a reported $2500 and was intended to be a central focus of the busy Broadway Street3. Inside the theater a projection booth and stage were added, as well as a balcony and an incline to the floor of the lower level2. The auditorium seats are mahogany wood, some are covered in green velour and some in red leather, that were installed by B.F. Shearer for a cost of $11,0004. In addition to the seats, the carpeting, drapery, and lighting fixtures were designed for the theater and were sourced from all over the country2. In the projection room, they installed two new Simplex Projection Machines that use Peerless Low Intensity Arc Lamps, as well as a double dissolving stereoptican to project effects for the vaudeville, spotlights, and numerous house lights5. It was announced that A. E. McDuffee would be in charge of the projection and Rex Stratton would be the organist5,6. The organ is a Wurlitzer-Hope Jones Unit Orchestra Organ that was shipped to Oregon in fifty crates and can recreate the sound of numerous instrument simultaneously so it sounds like a complete orchestra6.

Image from the Oregon Encyclopedia.The theater’s opening night was a major event attended by guests from all over the state, adding up to about 2250 people, so some people were turned away from the theater because both shows had reached capacity7. The theater also hosted a turkey dinner that lasted into the late night for the family and friends of the people who had worked to open the theater7. The opening night vaudeville included a jazz musical comedy, contortionists, and a mixture of other musical and comedy acts8. The opening film program featured Graustark, and later in the week The Pony Express and Bobbed Hair, and on Wednesday and Thursday of the first week will also include a newsreel8. 

In the summer of 1928 the theater announced that they would be adding the equipment for sound9. The theater installed Movietone and Vitaphone equipment, which had been ordered 8 months prior. The opening feature was “The Home Towners” from Warner Brothers, with many others including “The Jazz Singer” being shown in the next weeks10.",NA,"“Plan Big Theater in Noble Building South Broadway,” The Coos Bay Times, December 5, 1924: 1.

The theater was in the wooden Hodes building on a lot measuring 22’ x 160’. Local theater entrepreneur S.S. Range started the Electric, and soon sold the business to Mrs. Martha E. Watson. Mrs. Watson ran the Electric simultaneously with the Dreamland Theatre a few doors down.

The Electric showed the short films popular in nickelodeons at this time, such as the Passion Play, “Crack Riders of the Russian Cavalry” (1908), and film of the Wright Brothers historic airplane. The Electric used an “auxetophone,” an early type of gramophone, as sound accompaniment to the silent films.
Eugene Guard, Dec. 26, 1908, p. 12The theater building was irreparably damaged in a large fire that destroyed many of the buildings in downtown Eugene on May 25, 1909. The fire was not a projector fire, but one that started in a livery stable on Willamette St. Later that year, Mrs. Watson tried to sell the remains of the building and have it removed in order to build a new brick building on the same lot. In 1910 she opened the Folly Theatre in the new building.

Schrader (owner/operator), Cull Smith (owner), McCully, Rusk","The Electric Theater was first opened in July of 1908 by Cull Smith and his associate who ran the establishment, P.N. Schrader. It is unclear through digitized newspapers whether or not the theatre was open prior to this date, however, a clipping mentions that the theatre was “nicely fixed over for the pur-pose,” not built new for the occasion1. The same clipping mentions that the filmhouse was opening with a unique quality: that it would possess a motion picture machine that was “the first of its kind west of Denver, it being absolutely fireproof.” Though claimed by the theater management, this is very unlikely to be true, as many urban locations had a much easier time obtaining these machines, as well as the newer models. Pair this with the fact that mentioning the safety of a theatre was pivotal in obtaining and maintaining strong audiences in the industry, as many were conscious of the dangers present in movie-going. Lastly, the claim to fame for the Electric Theatre in Enterprise is that this was the so-called “headquarters” for a circuit that was created by Schrader and Smith, managed by Smith from an office he ran from the small town. By no means was this rare for this time period, but what is interesting is the locale in which the circuit resides. The area in Northeast Oregon was not that populated, but by ensuring you have some capital in each of the larger towns in this area, one can be sure they would strike up some amount of consistent business by bringing films to the more rural locations when not many other theatres were around to compete.
The first advertisement for the Theatre and their preliminary showings for the first weekendProprietors Smith and Schrader were often commended for their success in running a functional and entertaining establishment for the people that attended any of their circuit locations. A newspaper clipping after a few months of work from the theatre mentions that the location is “receiving a constantly increasing patronage,” and that “a longer and better show for the mon-ey is given by Messrs. Smith and S[c]hrader than is customary in mov-ing picture theaters”2. A typical bill runs as follows, based on an ad from The News Record: 3 moving pictures, “Pleasant Side of a Soldier’s Life,” “London: Regattas and Exhibition” and “What a Razor Can Do,” along with two other illustrated songs. Then, on the next day, 5 pictures, “One Legged Man,” ""It’s Not Cowl that Makes,” “Launching of the Fair Roma,” “Reprieved” and “Selfish Man” and 2 songs to close3. Though, some of the more interesting programming featured a Strong Man, named Samson and the Dieppe Circus of 1908.

      
            A shot of Main Street in Enterprise, the Electric is two blocks south from hereThrough to its end, it seems as though the management at the Electric Theatre always sought out to ensure a quality experience at the location. Roughly a month prior to the perceived closing of the theatre, there was a full article, rather than a simple block ad, that detailed a future selection of films for showing. In describing the films the writer states that the Electric Theatre is presenting an “entirely new and A1 class of films and songs...the expense to the management is doubled there-by but they are determined to give an entertainment of a character that will merit and receive liberal support”4. I believe this is key in detailing the history of the Electric Theatre and that the intent behind the presentation of films was for entertainment  of the clients that attended the shows, seemingly less so about the money derived from the practice. The Electric Theatre seemed to prosper up until roughly this point, where it is unclear exactly when the theater closed, however it was officially handed over to the Vest Brothers who developed the old theatre location into a meat market in October of 19095. This meat market is where I could find the physical location and depiction of the building/plot itself, as the Sanborn database did not carry the years that the Theatre was active.

Guthrie, Ralph Allen, West Coast Theaters, Inc.,","The Elsinore remains open today, and as a person who calls Salem their hometown, I am honored to research and create this profile about the Elsinore. I know first hand how much this theater affects and proliferates the culture of the community of Salem. A theater can be more than just a location for screening movies, it can be a place where cherished memories are made. And I certainly have cherished memories of this theater.

The Elsinore theater was constructed in 1926 by Salem businessman George B. Guthrie. Guthrie was the owner and operator of the famous Salem theater the Oregon theater from 1912 and onward. He paired with architects Lawrence and Holford from Portland (4) to create one of Oregon's most beautiful theaters. It was designed to resemble the castle of Elsinore from Shakespeare's Hamlet play. The theater was constructed for standard theater practice, having a stage measuring at 32 x 63 feet in area, and a loft of over 60 feet in height. The Elsinore also has full dressing rooms for performers in the basement. Although the theater was specifically built for standard Broadway theater style performance, other forms of entertainment such as vaudeville, live orchestra, and films (2,5,6,7,8) were also very popular. In fact, throughout its existence and before the opening of Salem's modern mall style movie theaters, the Elsinore acted as one of Salem's main movie theaters. In an exhibition ad for the Elsinore from the Oregon Statesman newspaper on January 23, 1927 (7), there is specific text letting readers know this ad is not for a film. This ad shows how popular films were at the Elsinore in and around 1927. The Elsinore had a habit of advertising their films in the newspaper with vibrant art attached to every section. The ad for Mary Pickford's Sparrows has designs of Mary Pickford dancing, and children (5). The ad for Lon Chaney's While The City Sleeps has a beautiful background design and a detailed rendition of Lon Chaney's dramatic face (8). These advertisements stand out next to standard ads. It would not be too far of an assumption to assume that the theater managers of the Elsinore made a conscious effort to make their advertisements vibrant and detailed as a promotional strategy.

            In 1927, the Elsinore and the Oregon theaters, both being owned by Mr. Guthrie, became part of West Coast Theaters, Inc., Guthrie remained the owner, however the theater would from then on, be run by West Coast Theaters (1). The theater kept its name, as the people of Salem came to know The Elsinore. A man by the name of Ralph Allen became the theater manager for both the Elsinore and the Oregon theaters. He was tested as a theater manager in Los Angeles by West Coast Theaters, Inc., and proved to be a good theater manager.

            Due to the popularity and size of the Elsinore, it had the financial ability to promote their programs on multiple full page spreads. This allows for a lot of exposure because it limits the amount of competing theaters advertisements.

            While the Elsinore theater seems to have had a great reputation among community members, the employees had a different view. At one point the stage hands walked out of the theater in protest.

As seen by this article, the issue is regarding workers' unions. Both the Elsinore and Bligh’s Capitol Theatre wanted to operate on a non-union basis.

The main attractions being moving pictures, illustrated songs, and matinee performances three times a day. The owner of the theater, George Rolfe, is included as one of the main performers in the show list. The admission for adults at the time was 10 cents, which was a common price; however, children got in for 5 cents on matinees. 
Albany Democrat, Jul. 12, 1912, p. 6, Newspapers.com.George Rolfe was the owner, and proprietor of the Empire theater. He also performed as a singer and was a master at attracting popular performers and moving pictures for his theater.
Albany Democrat, Dec. 4, 1908, p.3, Newspapers.com.December 1908: Here we can see a very interesting advertisement put into the Albany Democrat referring to the Jubilee singers, which was an African American a-cappella group from Fisk University in Tennessee. In the paper, there’s some very dated language referring to the group's looks. There are also some advertisements from other businesses just below the main advertisement.
Albany Democrat, Dec. 24, 1909, p.3, Newspapers.comDecember 1909: The Empire would often host a variety of acts on stage. Here we can see an advertisement for scientific rope-twirling, which could mean an assortment of things. It’s unknown what this performance pertained- one could infer a jump-roping act, a knot-tying act, or an educational exhibition for local businesses. What is important is that the theater would host a variety of different performances.

      
            Albany Democrat, Sep. 29, 1911, p. 8, Newspapers.com.September 1911: Proprietor of the Empire theater, George Rolfe, was very good at securing new acts for his theater on a regular basis. Here is an example of him attracting a popular singer from the time, Louis Hoffman, to perform for his theater. The Albany Democrat refers to his theater as “popular”, so it’s assumed that there was ample seating for people to enjoy a singer on stage.
Albany Democrat, Aug. 26, 1913, p. 9, Newspapers.com.August 1913: The owner of the Empire, George Rolfe, would often travel with associates to other states and perform. It is assumed that Rolfe would often advertise people to visit Oregon and come to his theater in Albany during these trips. Rolfe certainly seemed to be quite the active character- he did a lot of traveling, performing, and owned many theaters.  
Albany Democrat, Dec. 8, 1911, p. 2, Newspapers.com. December 1911: The Empire theater is rented out “through the kindness” of George Rolfe for an entire day to show an auto-show. Not a physical car-show, but a moving-picture car show that shows how some of the greatest cars in the world (at the time) were constructed. It was meant to be an educational piece sponsored by the Barrett Brothers.

Near the end of the theater's time, it seemed like it struggled with some issues with technical issues and crime, which could be why the owner decided to ultimately build a new theater in a different part of town.
Albany Democrat, Oct. 4, 1912, p. 11, Newspapers.com. October 1912: An electrical current so strong caused technical difficulties to the picture machine, and the Empire had to cancel its show for the night. George Rolfe did end up giving out refunds, and the issue was fixed by the next day. George Rolfe certainly seemed like a good, hard-working man who respected his audience, and loved his theater.

It was known as the quintessential community theatre with a clean and quiet reputation amongst patrons in Nob Hill. The theatre started with primarily showing vaudeville and silent films. Over time, they showing many classic films over the years. According to The Oregonian, in 1968, the Esquire received an exclusive deal to feature the film ""The Pink Panther,"" which was one of the most famous comedies at the time[1]. The Esquire had various sold-out showings for the film and continued to grow in popularity as well known for businesses. According to an article written by Bill Peterson for Oregon magazine, the name “Esquire” is greatly attributed to the State Cinema 21 Theatre, which is located in Portland presently and carries a strong resemblance to the Nob Hill Theatre/ The Esquire[1]. Although the Esquire was primarily popular amongst moviegoers in the Nob Hill neighborhood, it had a tremendous impact on other theatres at this time. 

Although there was an abundance of advertisements when it was under operation as the Nob Hill Theatre, the Esquire hardly published advertisements in local newspapers[2].  For example, the Esquire would commonly advertise on posters for local events in order to receive traction from the community, their affordable ticket prices, and various celebrities attending their showings[3]. Utilizing poster advertising rather than newspaper advertising allowed their audience to be more local. Since ",NA,"1.

Eugene Theatre,"490 Willamette St., Eugene, Oregon","Eugene, OR",44° 3.15000' N,123° 5.58333' W,1903-11-17,1903,1922-10-01,1922,600,"George H. Smith, Doc Hollenbeck, Cal M. Young","The Eugene Theatre was located at 490 Willamette St. (the same address became 636 Willamette when the street numbering system changed in 1913). It sat roughly in the same location as the current Hult Center for the Performing Arts.

The Eugene Theatre was built as an opera house at the turn of the 20th century for a provincial city of barely more than 4,000 people. Yet it managed to thrive as a showcase for big touring plays, musicals, and vaudeville acts, and, increasingly in the 1910s, moving picture shows.

In the first two decades of its heyday, however, the Eugene was primarily a live performance venue and some of the biggest names in theater appeared on its grand stage, including Al Jolson in 1915.

The Eugene did show movies as early as 1907 when manager George H. Smith booked a night of Biograph shorts provided by a traveling movie exhibitor. Tickets for this show were definitely not nickelodeon prices: 15¢ and 25¢. Movies became a more frequent part of the programming after 1913, and by 1915 they were a regular feature. Many of the films screened conformed to the same “high-class” tone of the theater, including travel pictures and other “educational” films. The Eugene arranged with the Portland-based Pathé film exchange to show their features and newsreels, which were “known to be the very highest class” that could “please any audience.” Movie show prices remained a bit higher than the other theaters in town, 25-50¢ for an evening show in 1913, compared to 10-15¢ elsewhere.

The Eugene hosted the much-anticipated local premiere of Birth of a Nation in the summer of 1916. The theater’s manager “Doc” Hollenbeck ran daily newspaper ads for a month prior to attract patrons, promising a 30-piece live orchestra to accompany the silent film.

By the winter of 1917, the Eugene Theatre was advertising a weekly program with movies showing six days out of the week. The films included “Draft 258” (Metro Pictures), “Kill Joy” (Perfection), and “The Brand of Satan” (Peerless).

In the October 1922, new owners changed the name to the Heilig, and later converted it to a movies-only theater in 1926. It was demolished in 1973.

Family Theater,"115 SE Emigrant Ave, Pendleton, OR 97801","Pendleton, OR",45° 40.28333' N,118° 47.10000' W,1904-06-13,1904,1904-07-13,1904,350,"Jack Thompson, Milo McMinn","The Family Theater was opened on June 13, 1904 as the Pantheon, in Pendleton, Oregon. It was located on the corner of Webb and Cottonwood (present-day 1st Street and Emigrant Avenue). It opened under the management of Jack Thompson as a “strictly moral, refined, and up-to-date theater” (Figure 1). Throughout its month as an operating theater, it consistently advertised that it was a high class theater, encouraging women and children to come see its refined entertainment.. It was primarily a vaudeville theater, programming mostly comedy acts and singing (Figure 2). However, it also had a Vitascope, which it installed a mere two days after its grand opening (Figure 3). The vitascope played moving pictures and illustrated songs, and was usually advertised in conjunction with several vaudeville acts in the newspapers (Figure 4).

Sometime between June 23 and June 27, Thompson changed the name of the theater to the Family Theater, which it maintained as its name until close. The audience of the theater did not change with its name, however. It still played clean programs that upper class patrons would approve of. That doesn’t mean its shows weren’t problematic, however; it often advertised black face performances (Figure 5). The programs changed every Monday, inviting new performers each week. On July 2, 1904, the management of the theater switched from Jack Thompson to Milo McMinn (Figure 6). This is likely when the theater started to go downhill. It was attached to a restaurant called the Pantheon Saloon, and on July 7, that restaurant switched management as well, going from Sam Roberts to George Cruise. Cruise said that his restaurant would be “in no wise connected” with an adjacent theater, which points to trouble at the Family Theater. Indeed, by July 13, an ad was placed in the paper for a room to rent (Figure 7) in the space which was previously occupied by the Pantheon. Finally, on July 14, the paper published a short article that said that McMinn had been forced to close down the Family Theater due to a lack of patronage. It had been open for just under a month. Unfortunately, no images of the theater survive as far as can be seen, since it was open for such a short period of time.

In a clever promotional strategy, they devised a contest to name the new theater, and ""Folly"" won out.
Eugene Guard, April 18, 1910, p. 8. Newspapers.comThe Folly provided a mix of movies and vaudeville acts in its programming. One night included a musical program by MISS BARROWS and MISS GOODHUE, “the silver-voiced singers,” along with Biograph and Selig short films, a Mary Pickford/D.W. Griffith short feature called “White Roses,” and four other short films.

Admission varied from 5¢-25¢, depending on the content of the show and whether it was a matinee or evening. The program changed daily; “WE DON’T RUN REPEATERS” promised one ad from 1910. The Folly ran regular ads in the Eugene Daily Guard. The promotions boasted of excellent ventilation and daily disinfection during the summer months, and “a warm and comfortable” house during the winter.

      
            In June 1915, J.J. (Joseph) Bryan purchased a half-ownership in the Folly with Mrs. Watson. Bryan was the former owner of the Grand, Electric, and Bell theaters in Springfield, and the Aloha, (later the Savoy,) in Eugene. He and Mrs. Watson remodeled and expanded the Folly, taking over the cigar store in order to install additional seating—bringing the capacity up to 675. They also created a large, dramatic arch over the theater entrance, and ordered a pipe organ. All together, the renovations cost between $4,000-$5,000. The newly renovated theater was re-opened to Eugene movie fans in July 1915 as the Oregon theater.

The theater was located on the 200 block of Burnside St. The grand opening of the theater was featured in an ad in The Morning Oregonian. It was advertised that the building was “remodeled and enlarged” at a cost of about $20,000. That is the equivalent of about $600,000 today! I would like to believe that much money went into a theater renovation, but advertising that amount could have also just been used to draw in more theatergoers. The opening article draws in the locals by announcing the opening bill which will feature acrobatics, vocalists, dancers, and of course, Edison’s newest invention: the kinetoscope. The theater promoted itself as a “high-class vaudeville theater”, which is interesting considering that I found a few articles mentioning the controversy surrounding Fred Fritz after the opening of his theater.

            Before Fritz opened the theater on 2nd and Burnside, he owned a few saloons in the same area. Fritz is mentioned in the Labosier article, From the Kinetoscope to the Nickelodeon, in that when something controversial was brought up about Fritz, one would say, “Oh, it’s only Fritz’s, you must expect such things here” (313). Fritz had gained a major reputation of being controversial in Portland that the police would regularly perform blockades or searches at his theater. According to The Morning Oregonian, police performed a blockade at the theater in December of 1906. It consisted of police entering the building every ten minutes to make sure the business was complying with city ordinances. This was because women who were supposed to be part of the vaudeville acts were reported to be selling drinks to male patrons at “outrageous” prices. Inspector Bruin says that “Fritz’ Theater is a cancer on the city”. Another statement made about the theater is that “the women he employs are flagrant” and that “no one can imagine any place that could be worse”.
The Morning Oregonian. Sep. 6, 1902, p. 9. Historic Oregon Newspapers. 

While I could not find any articles about Fritz's Theater permanently closing, there are two articles from 1907 of Fritz being threatened to close by not complying to adhere to fire safety regulations. There was shock around this because Fritz had been arrested 13 times in relation to illegally selling liquor, but it was fire hazards that led to almost having to close his theater if he did not make the correct changes. Some of the hazards include the seats being too close together, no automatic sprinkler apparatus, and no exit lights. However by 1908, according to the Sanborn Maps, Fritz had made those renovations and it is stated that Grinnell automatic sprinklers were installed. 

Later in 1908, The Morning Oregonian would report about the chief of police would be leading a raid in removing “objectionable picture machines”. This raid was ordered by the District Attorney, John Manning, and he wanted any film unfit for public exhibition to be removed. He also wanted the machines showing the films to be removed by force if it was deemed necessary. These so-called obscene films were owned by the one and only Fred Fritz, the “proprietor of the notorious theater on Second and Burnside Streets”. Fritz’s business partner, J. W. West, was the manager of the theater and they both owned a chain of penny arcades located throughout the Pacific Northwest. What I found most interesting in this article were the lengths in which numerous officials went out of their way to secure arrests against theater proprietors. Given that Fritz had been arrested about 13 times by 1907, I cannot imagine the lengths he had to go through to keep his businesses running.

According to the Portland directories, Mrs. Elizabeth Sax was the theater owner. I believe the programming tended to be well balanced because there was a newspaper ad specifically looking for a lady piano player.  With the theater playing movies and live music, I would assume Sax always kept her eye out for more talent to showcase. It is also important to note that the theater owner was a woman and that she was looking for female talent. Although I did not find any other owners attached the the theater, one could assume Mrs. Elizabeth Sax attempted to involve females in any of the talent that was displayed. 

I did not find any specific newspaper advertisements that was selling certain entertainment at the theater, but there were some newspaper tie-ins. One of the newspaper articles discussed that a reel of films caught on fire causing a panic among attendees after 6pm. It seems as if there was not much damage to the theater from this accident. Another newspaper tie-in mentions that someone stood in front of the theater with signs on both sides of their body, also referred to as a “sandwich man” with an “unfair-to-organized-labor” sign. After this occurred, the owner replied by sending armed bodyguards outside of the theater. I was not able to find any other information on this event, but it is clear that people who worked for the theater felt as if they were not treated fairly and that their experience of the theater was the opposite of “fun”.

Gay Theater,805 Mississippi Ave.,"Portland, OR",45° 32.80000' N,122° 40.53333' W,1915-03-16,1915,1920-09-19,1920,unknown,R. S. Phillips,"The Gay Theater Came into operation around the end of the Nickelodeon era. Most advertisements for the theater did not start appearing until the year of 1915. Before then, the theater had no announcement for a grand opening or start of operation. With the minimal amount of information on the theater in existence it suggests the theater was not in operation very long or was simply beat out in competition. Given that the Gay Theater was in operation during a period of time when there was more than 20 theaters in the city of Portland at the time the theater had its share of competition. In order for it to have stay in operation and be successful for a long standing period of time it would have needed to have some incentive for movie goers to visit its establishment.

However, most articles that mentioned the Gay Theater were for popular movies being premiered that year. Newspapers would put out a list of theaters and the locations for locals to know where the film was being shown. Since most theaters were showing the same film the choice of what theater to visit must have been based on other factors such as atmosphere and convenience. If the Gay Theater lacked the elegance of a theater palace or was too pricey in comparison to theaters nearby, it would most likely lose out to its competitors.
""The Iron Claw"" advertisement for the Sunday Oregonian in 1916 

      
            Fortunately, as mentioned before the Gay Theater was able to maintain its footing by participating in mass showings of popular films being released at the time. Films like The Exploits of Elaine1 and The Iron Claw2 are examples of films that were heavily advertised in multiple newspapers throughout a several month span creating a significant awareness of the films.
List of theaters showcasing the ""Exploits of Elaine""The Gay Theater most likely kept afloat because it was owned by R. S. Phillips. Phillips came to Portland around 19113. He was originally from Vancouver, B.C., which was often how he was referred and referenced in newspapers. He was mentioned in an article about street pavements in Portland but did not reference how or why he had extensive knowledge on the matter. He must have been some what of a figure in Portland because he was invited to private picture-plays4 and the newspaper would make announcements about when he and his wife were going on vacation5.

Mention of Phillips and the Gay Theater seem to stop after the year 1920 with no real reason as to why. For this reason it is unclear when and why the Gay Theater closed down. With the lack of information about the theater trying to diversify or appeal to the movie going experience. It could've simply just stopped having business, however, this is unclear given the know facts about the establishment.",NA,"1Morning Oregonian. ""Elaine—the Brilliant."" March 10, 1915.

Four years later, in 1927, Geller worked with architect Edward A. Miller to construct a vaudeville house with “a Golden 20’s aesthetic.” The theater was called, simply, ""Geller's."" The theater played host to vaudeville performers such as “Jack Benny, until the mid 1930s when the demand for cinema overtook that for live performance,” (Lime, 1). The auditorium of the Geller is still the same as it was nearly a century ago, with 620 seats, a balcony, chandelier, organ grilles, and the entire front marquee are all still intact today – minus the infamously grand “Geller’s Theatre” sign. In the early 1930s, the theater was equipped with a projector and a small screen to host movie-going audiences and transitioned away from its show house style. In 1934, the Geller Theatre was renamed the “Aladdin Theatre,” which remained an all-ages cinema until the 1970s when it became an adult entertainment theater. Today, the Aladdin is still open and hosting live musical performances.

From the Oregon Daily Journal in 1913 of April, there is an advertisement from the General Film Company on 7th St in Portland, providing a list of theatres it provides it's films for. Among these theatres two are named ""The Gem"", however I chose the one that already had a written address on the advertisement. 

What was interesting however was the type of theatre that the Gem was, and that is a photo-play theatre. A photo-play theatre is one that shows true theatre that was filmed and released as a ""film"". This is an interesting mix of cinema, vaudeville, and true theatre. This was, in my opinion, probably chosen as a way to draw various audiences since film was so new and many were unsure of its success. 

Throughout the research process, I found no traces of this theatre advertising it's programming, and pricing. Much like my last theatre, the Novelty, there is almost no trace of this theatre existing besides snippets here and there. However, with the Gem theatre, understanding the novelty that it only showed photo-plays, gave me knowledge that this theatre probably did not make much money here in the city of Portland. 

The most difficult about this research project specifically was finding another popular theatre in Portland, Maine. This was an island and is popular as a tourist attraction, about a century ago, this theatre would show both live theatre and films.

Partridge","Back in the early 1900s, movie theaters did not last for very long. They would be open for only a few years, maybe even just a few months if they were unlucky. One theater that was able to avoid this fate was the Gem Theater in Tillamook, Oregon. Opening in 1909 and not closing until 1924, it enjoyed a successful 15 years of business, almost unheard of for the time. Despite this runaway success, there was nothing super unique about the Gem. Like most theaters at the time, it had live shows like music, vaudeville, or school plays in addition to motion pictures and upgraded its technology and building over the years. Although it did not have the most unique entertainment, the Gem was able to make itself an important part of the community. It hosted many shows by students at the nearby school, churches, and clubs that wanted to use the theater1. This could have made it popular with residents of the town as they knew local citizens used it instead of big film companies. The Gem was also recognized in the newspaper for contributing proceeds from a showing to the Red Cross. This led to the paper describing the theater as “a nice place of amusement, fireproof, and up-to-date” and noted that the owners “show[ed] a lively interest and willingness to help out, and [were] entitled to considerable credit form the people of the city and county”2.



 

      
            Based on the paper, it is clear that at least the person writing the article was a fan of the theater and its owners end enjoyed going there. The Gem also made it clear that it cared about its customers. When it had been reported that prices at the Gem were raised to 15 cents the owner published a brief article in the paper stating that “[that] was absolutely false” and only true for a few specific showings. Other than that, prices remained at the low cost of 10 cents and 5 cents3. Like all theaters, the Gem had to upgrade its facilities over the years. This included things like adding a stage, remodeling the lobby, and improving the stage to add a dressing room and a larger orchestra pit4, 5, 6. Since the theater stayed up to date with the latest technology and amenities, the owners were able to advertise that they were a high-quality theater that ran “exclusively first-class films”7. By offering the best entertainment and integrating itself as an important part of the community, the Gem Theater was able to maintain a very successful business.",NA,"Tillamook Headlight, March 31, 1910.

            In an effort to support the Albany Red Cross Association, the Globe theater collaborated with the organization and showed a film titled A Modern Mother Goose. The Red Cross was responsible for the film while the theatre’s manager made concessions in order to provide the organization with a greater share of the profits for tickets sold. In order to attract a broader audience, tickets were sold at local drug stores and other various retailers throughout the city. There was also a solicitation for tickets, with tickets being sold for 25 cents, 15 cents for children. Beyond the film, several specialty acts were provided by local entertainment in order create a successful and diverse night of entertainment.

A collaborative effort between the Globe theater and the University of Oregon Woman’s Glee Club is shown in an advertisement for a concert, benefiting the woman’s building fund. Tickets were sold at Woodworth’s Drug Store a day prior to the fundraiser.

Hill","According to The Oregonian, the Globe Theater's opening night was September 14th, 1912, the Globe offered films interspersed with songs, and selections from their organ which was specifically engineered for The Globe, within a safe, allegedly fireproof, theater with seating for 800 people, the theater could have had 100 more seats but instead opted to sacrifice them in lieu of a less cramped feeling theater and also for a safer theater, a safe theater seemed to be a top priority for The Globe as the theater also had more exits than was legally necessary (1).

The Globe was, predominantly, a film exhibitor. The Globe promoted their films with large ads, in which The Globe made sure to prominently feature their address, Eleventh and Washington, so that the theater was easily located (2)(3)(4). The Globe also ran other programs and events. For instance, The Globe featured plays like Dion Boucicault's The Shaughraun (5). The Globe also had meet and greets. For instance, in 1917 The Globe had Joe Knowles, the famous nature man who appeared in films, come to the theater to show his latest film and also talk to and teach Boy Scouts wood crafting (6).

            The Globe had contests to further promote their theater. For example, The Globe featured a puzzle contest with one grand prize winner and three other places paying out prizes that could be obtained by calling The Globes box office (7).

The original owner, of The Globe, is unknown at the moment. However, Jack O'Neill and his sister Ellen O'Neill owned the theater at its closing, when the siblings sold The Globe to John Hammrick, a Seattle showman, who changed the name of The Globe to The Blue Mouse (8).

Guthrie,"The Globe theater which first opened in in 1912 is a long lasting theater that has seen many renovations, taken on different names and has had it fair share of motion pictures. In the early years of the Globe theater there where a lot of financial issues as owning such a large piece of property at the time was expensive. The first few years of showings would end up costing the locals a whopping ten cents for adults and five cents for children. The showings that would occur would be a mix between comedy, drama and then a live performance from either bands or singers. From 1912 to 1918 there where a few important renovations that happened at the Globe theater. during these renovations the name changed from the Globe Theater to the Oregon Theater. Looking at the renovations that occurred the first happened in 1915 where there was a lobby that was added  as well as the floor being dropped to add an angle towards the stage and screen. The second round of renovations happened in 1918 where most theaters where unable to maintain rent due to the flu outbreak that happened during the early 1900s. George B. Guthrie took this time as an opportunity to expand and beautify the theater as a whole. Originally the Globe opened up with 542 seats but after this renovation and the name change there was a total of 700 seats. in conclusion the theater ended up having ""rich colored ceilings"" and ""scenic alcoves on the stage"" in order to provide the best experience ever. 
The Daily Capital Journal, January 23, 1913, Newspaper.com 

      
            The Daily Capital Journal, November 30, 1912, Newspaper.comThough the Globe Theater focused on motion pictures, there where also live performances in the earlier years. For example in an advertisement in 1912 there was a live performance by Ralph Raymond a singer, but this was an event that happened at the end of the week in the later evenings. The live performances tended to be in the later evenings as the theater needed to get through their showings such as ""The Voice of Warning"" or ""When Wealth Tormets."" 

      
      
  
          
            When looking at the promotional tactics that where being used during the early 1920s, the Newspaper was a big hit as not only did everyone wake up have a cup of coffee and read the local paper but it was an easy and cheap way to get your advertisement in-front of many eyes. The biggest think to focus on was, getting the theaters name in the biggest and boldest font possible in a big enough newspaper square so that when reader was flipping through, their eyes would gravitate. Not only that but the Globe did a great job of promoting local and popular artist in order to expand their audience. It is said in an article below that the Globe was one of the last standing theaters after many years of financial issues and that comes down to the ability to advertise the things that are important to the local population. The Globe not only advertised the showings that where happening but they also brought in advertisements of renovations and these are the things that the audience wants to read about. ","Owner of Globe Theater also owned the Grand Theater in Salem , First named the Globe Theater was then renamed to the Oregon Theater in 1915 , John Mallory and Charles Davenport put money towards the theater but got into a legal situation which led to George B.

It existed at the same time as the Majestic theater, which is believed to occupy the building at 128 Cass St., according to the Digital Sanborn Maps. Some articles note the Golden theater being located on “Rose and Cass Streets,” implying the theater was located on the corner of those two streets (1). Because the language in newspaper ads is vague, the exact address of the Golden theater is unknown.

The Golden Theatre played a variety of pictures, from dramas to comedies, and even a “hand colored” Pathe film (2).

Like other theaters that existed in Roseburg, the Golden theater included a tagline in its newspaper advertisements. The Golden’s catchphrase was “Just as Bright,” and it appeared in many ads (3).

            This newspaper ad promotes a collaboration with Stubbs & Perman, a local grocery store (1). The copy reads that one thousand people who shop at the grocery store will receive free movie tickets from the Golden theater. Underneath this ad, the theater paid for another block of advertising that humorously states that their “prices never change,” so customers will always be able to afford to take their families to the movies (1). In fact, the Golden kept admission at 5 cents well into the 1910s, long after the ""Nickelodeon"" era ended.

The theater closed for several months in mid-1915 and re-opened in September under the new management of William Perman. The Golden closed for good only a few weeks later when Perman was arrested for running a gambling operation (4).

Hartman","The date of the Grand theater's opening is unknown. The earliest found newspaper article, that references the Grand theater, is the June 7th, 1913 edition of Moving Picture World. The article states that the Grand theater is the furthest west photoplay house in the US, that the theater is steam heated, has a seating capacity of 450, and that the Grand had quite a large stage (1). The article, also, mentions that no vaudeville has been shown for a ""long time"" (1), which gives the implications that the theater has been open for sometime before this article was published, even though this article was the earliest found piece of evidence of this theater. This means that theater more than likely opened before 1913. 
Moving Picture World, Jun. 7, 1913, p. 1016. Media History Digital Library.The Grand theater's earliest found owner/manager was W. C. Sellmer (1). According to the Bandon Recorder, Sellmer made renovations to the theater in September of 1914; Sellmer removed the old proscenium arch, the arch above the screen, and added in two Doric pillars, this was done so that the screen could be placed at the rear of the stage, thus giving a better view of the screen (2). The next owner, E. A. Hartman, purchased the Grand theater from W. C. Sellmer on March 23, 1918 (3). E. A. Hartman was a woman entrepreneur, and a prolific theater owner, in the Bandon area. She owned most, if not all, of the theaters in Bandon, including the Orpheum theater, the Bandon theater, and the Hartman theater (4) (5). 
Moving Picture World, Mar. 23, 1918, p. 1699. Media History Digital Library. 

      
            E. A. Hartman owned the theater for three years until October 25th, 1921 when, according to the Morning Oregonian, the Grand theater caught fire and caused over $20,000, almost $300,000 in today's money, in damage (6). The fire was able to be stopped, before it spread to other buildings, but the damage was done to the Grand theater, causing the theater to be put out of business on October 25th, 1921. 
The Morning Oregonian, Oct. 26, 1921, p. 4. Newsbank Database.The Grand Theater had many film advertisements on display in the Bandon Recorder. The Grand theater featured films such as Esmeralda, which starred Mary Pickford (7), A Woman's Resurrection, a film from William Fox (8), and The Last Days of Pompeii, which was a six-reel extravaganza (9). The prices for these films ranged from 5 cents to 25 cents. The prices varied depending on age range, kids under ten paid less, and what type of film was playing, a larger scale film cost more to see. 

Films appeared to be the Grand theater's focal point in exhibition but they also exhibited differing vaudeville acts, as well. The Bandon Recorder had an article which stated that a vaudeville duo, Dale and Long, was appearing at the Grand theater. The duo would put on dances, do comic monologues, and sing songs (10). The Bandon Recorder, also, had an article which mentions a strongman show that was performed at the Grand theater. Jim Wilson and Smiling Dutch performed eye opening feats of strength, which showed off the duos perfect control of their bodies (11).

Even with the Grand theaters copious amounts of advertisements, the Grand didn't think that it was necessary to put their address in any of their ads. This was, more than likely, because Bandon is a very small town, meaning that the population of Bandon, would have already known where the theater was located. The address was only able to be found by referencing the Sanborn fire insurance map (12). 

The Sanborn fire insurance map doesn't specifically list the Grand theater on the map but instead lists the building as a moving picture house (12). However, this building is also listed as a I.O.O.F Hall. This abbreviation stands for Independent Order of Odd Fellows and according to the article in the Morning Oregonian the Grand theater had the Odd Fellows hall inside of the theater's building (6). So, it can be assumed that this is the correct Sanborn map for this building.",NA,"1. Moving Picture World, Jun. 7, 1913, p. 1016. Media History Digital Library.

Grand,"187 High St N.E., Salem, Oregon","Salem, OR",44° 56.43333' N,123° 2.23333' W,1900-11-29,1900,2022-06-21,2022,"Initially 744, Reduced to 380","Independent Order of Odd Fellows, George B. Guthrie , T.G. Bligh, A.B. Cables , Carole Smith,  Meduri Family, John F. Cordray, A.E. Lafler","The Grand theater opened on November 29, 1900, in Salem, Oregon. It was built on the corner of High and Court streets by the fraternal organization known as the Independent Order of Odd Fellows. Initially it was managed by John F. Cordray, who also operated a number of theaters in Portland, including the People's theater (1). The theater was wired for electricity when it opened, but the programming focused on primarily on live theater, musical performances, and vaudeville. Moving pictures were shown as early as 1901 when The Passion Play (1898) screened to an enthusiastic audience (2).

Later it was managed and operated by George B. Guthrie until 1925 when he sold to Portland theater maven Calvin Heilig. The theater became the Heilig for less than a year when Guthrie resumed ownership and restored the Grand name. T.G. Bligh and his son Frank owned the theater for a period before eventually selling the Grand once again to A.B. Cables. It is unclear exactly how long Cables owned and managed the theater, however a young woman known as Carole Smith purchased the theater in 2000. Similar to the theater's other owners, Smith managed and operated the Grand for around 14 years before she decided to sell to the theater's current owners of today: the Meduri family, in 2015 (11).

Unfortunately the theater is no longer exclusively that, a theater. The Grand is most commonly used today for business functions, weddings, lectures or other major events with the use of its now converted ballrooms, offices, and conference rooms. However, it still on occasion functions as a theater for performing arts entertainment featuring events such as local theater productions, movies, and concerts (3).

Image courtesy of Salem Public Library Historic Photograph Database.Over the Grand theater's 100-plus years in operation it has undergone several remodels including one just recently under its new management. The theater was originally built with three stories and a bell tower, however at the start of the buildings operation it was still primarily used for Independent Order of Odd Fellows business and social events.

Unfortunately the large bell tower atop the theater was lost in 1937 due to damage from a snow storm and was never rebuilt (13). The Grand acquired its signature electric sign some time in the early 1930's but was also eventually damaged by wear and tear. When the Meduri family purchased the building and conducted their remodeling in 2016, they were able to reintroduce a replica of the original to the theatre and give modern patrons an idea of what it would have been like 80 years ago (13). The physical differences in the building over the years can more clearly be seen in the photos within the article. On the left is a photo taken of the Grand in the 1920's with the presence of its bell tower and was taken before the sign was first built. The photograph in the right column depicts the Grand without its bell tower but with the electric Grand sign replica.

      
            As most theaters featured live music during the silent era, the Grand was no different. The theater had two documented organs over the years and was also often accompanied by the Grand String Orchestra during the showings of silent films (13). Some of the many productions shown at the theater included, ""The Right of Way,"" and John Philip Sousa's comic operetta ""El Capitan"" (13,14). These were just two of the very wide and diverse range of concerts put on by the Grand theater in its early years.

The Grand theater often tried to appeal to a wide variety of audiences throughout its career and that often included showgirl performances. One example was dictated in advertisement published through the Capitol Journal in 1920 announcing the ""Glorious Girls Galore,"" a ""famous musical comedy"" put on by John Corts and featured an augmented orchestra, fabulous, bold costumes, and of course singing and dancing (8).

In contrast, the Grand theater also attracted many other patrons of all shapes and sizes or class and backgrounds. The Grand was known for hosting educational courses often free to the public among other charitable events during the afternoons. In addition the many office spaces were rented out, as they still are today to other businesses or organizations to host retail sales, community service, receptions, or as general gathering or meeting spaces (4,13).

Image Courtesy of Salem's Historic Grand.On one special occasion the Grand hosted a Robin Hood themed event to parallel their showing of the film in 1922. They released an advertisement/ coupon in the newspaper a few months prior in October of 1921. If patrons were to keep this coupon to their showing they would receive a discount on ticket sales. It was also an option to mail the ad in to the theatre and receive tickets at the door. This was an early way of incentivizing and actively involving patrons in the movie exhibiting process. Of course it is still a common practice to see similar ideas today. Offering the audience the semblance or prospect of controlling their own movie experience further drives them to remain involved and spend more money (5).

      
      
  
          
            The Grand participated in advertising tie-ins with automobile companies, like this one from 1914. The Maxwell Motor Company produced a film of their steel works and car factories, and local Maxwell distributors teamed up with theaters to show the film. Maxwell either provided the film for free or paid theaters to show it, as admission was free. This film served not only to advertise Maxwell cars, but to bring an audience to the Grand for a free movie. Perhaps people not otherwise interested in films would be drawn in by the “educational” nature of the film. Increased exposure could lead to more potential audience members in the future, turning this car advertising stunt into an equally effective advertising ploy for the Grand. On this occasion in Salem, hundreds of people turned out to see the film despite inclement weather, and the next day’s newspaper declared the showing “of intense interest” (15).

Another automobile tie-in appeared in 1915, when Ye Liberty and the Grand teamed up for a giant prize giveaway. The competition was based on nominations, which had to be submitted on paper at the Grand theater office. The individual with the most nominations won the grand prize, and other prizes were offered as well. The first-place prize was a brand-new Buick, and the total value of all prizes was around $2600 (around $65,000 in 2018 dollars). This extravagant outlay of capital was probably possible due to T. G. Bligh’s involvement with the theater (he is listed as the proprietor in the 1917 Salem City Directory, though exactly what his relationship was with the theater is unclear). The value of prizes offered probably was enough incentive to draw people to the Grand’s office, with the result that the Grand would become more widely recognized among the citizenry of Salem.

Rudow","Grand Theatre Opening Day 1916The Grand Theatre located in Bend, Oregon opened on December, 8th, 1916 (1) and doesn't have a definite closing date. In one newspaper clipping from May 1931 an advertisement for a “Free Dance” stated that the event was held in “the old Grand Theatre building” (14) and there are ads for the Grand Theatre up until October in 1930 so, it closed somewhere in between October of 1930 and May of 1931. The Grand Theatre had 300 seats and charged anywhere from 5 cents up to 50 cents. This theater was located on Bond St. in the historic O’Kane Building. In 1922, the owner of the O’Kane Building, Hugh O’Kane, was fined $25 for not heating the building at an appropriate temperature. J. B. Sparks, the owner of the Grand Theatre at the time, testified that he saw the temperature was 44 degrees when it was supposed to be kept at 65 degrees. This testimony was scrapped and O’Kane pled not guilty to the crime and it seemed as though nothing came of the case (6&7). The Grand Theatre seemed to be a place that everyone in Bend knew of to the extent that other companies described their locations as “Opposite Grand Theatre” so their customers knew to go to the Grand Theatre and then cross the street in order to find them (13).
Grand Theatre in 1921 

      
            Bond St. in 1917The Grand Theatre changed hands in 1923 and this new management promised to “always show the best of pictures and as soon after the first run in Portland as is possible” (10). In 1925, Bend joined Paramount Week and the Grand Theatre showed popular Paramount films at the time. Showing popular, well known films seemed to be something that the Grand really strived for and always included in their programming. This theater also held many local events for the community to attend including the Fire Department’s comedy show and a Wrestling Match (5&8). These events seemed like a great way to get people to come into the theater and be exposed to it and then want to come back for a film. Another way the Grand Theatre got people to come in was through their advertisements, contests, and deals. Their advertisements often had a very thick black border in order to separate it from the rest of the page (11) and sometimes they were shaped in a theme that was related to the film being shown. For example, they made an ad that was shaped like a cross when they showed, “The Life of Our Savior” on Good Friday (3). The Grand Theatre also held some Baby Contests that ranked the babies to see who the most popular baby in Bend was. The prizes included a gold locket and cash for runner ups (2). There was also “Booster Days” held at the Grand in which tickets were 11 cents only if you had the correct change (4). They also held special matinees for school children that cost 5 cents (12) in addition to their showings just for children that were free for children. At these showings they promised “a Souvenir to every boy and girl who [came] to meet [them]” (9). These promotional strategies seemed to work and happened very frequently.

Grand Theatre,"525 Main Street, Oregon City, Oregon","Oregon City, OR",45° 21.43333' N,122° 36.56667' W,1908-05-02,1908,1929-09-01,1929,250,"Charles Schram, owner and manager (1908-1929), George Simmons, owner (1908-1911)","The Grand Theatre was Oregon City’s second theater to show films and like many other theaters at the time featured variety performances rather than focusing on only films to make a revenue (5). Nevertheless, in a small town such as Oregon City it is quite remarkable that there would be two different theaters that showed movies in as early as 1908. The theater was opened on May 2nd, 1908 and located on Main Street between Seventh and Eighth streets in Oregon City (16). In 1909, however, the theater moved to its enduring location at 525 Main Street in a building that was owned by Charles Schram (17). This building was remodeled to house the theater and among other novel technologies had a raised floor, ventilation, and good lighting (4).
Originally, the theater was owned by Charles Schram and George Simmons but in 1911, Schram bought out Simmons’ holdings on the theater and became the sole owner and manager (21). The theater did good business, so much so that 1911 reports show that patrons often had to stand to enjoy a show. Undoubtedly to accommodate more visitors, between 1911 and 1912, the Grand Theatre was enlarged to accommodate 250 seats (23)(27). Moreover, in 1912, Schram acquired two new pianos, a Kimball grand piano and an Electric piano, for the theater (27). Business was good clearly as the Morning Enterprise reported in 1913 that Schram was planning to remodel the theater yet again and enlarge the stage to 22 by 30 feet and the seating capacity to somewhere between 500 and 700 seats (41). This plan apparently did not come to fruition as the theater continued to have only 250 seats up through the 1920s (60). Perhaps in hopes that the saying “like a moth to a flame” would work in a more literal sense, Schram installed a flaming area lamp in front of his theater. This was the first such lamp ever seen in Oregon City and it lit up the street to each side of it for quite some distance. The idea of this lamp was most likely borrowed from that of the managers of the Majestic and Peoples’ theaters in Portland which had similar lamps (43). Portland theaters were a great source of inspiration for Schram and the facade of the theater was remodeled in 1915 to resemble a “big town theater” (56). Yet another improvement to the theater was done in 1917 when Schram had new projection equipment installed in anticipation of another successful season (57). Business did stall for a bit in 1918 when there was a strike at the paper mills in town but soon got back on track (1)(2)(54). Schram told the Moving Picture World that business had “improved” after the strike and that he would continue doing good as there was no fear of influenza in Oregon City. The reporter theorized that the “sulphur fumes” from the paper mills may be what helps keep the place “clean” (1).
(""The Banner-Courier,"" April 13, 1922, page 7. Historic Oregon Newspapers)Tickets were 10 cents until 1915 when prices were raised to 15 cents (55)(58). Even then, feature films were often priced at 20 or 25 cents (9)(14)(20). D.W. Griffith’s Birth of a Nation was probably one of the most expensive showings and cost 50 cents for adults and 25 for children (59). In “Yuletide spirit,” prices were briefly taken down to 10 cents in 1915 during the duration of the Christmas season (10).
The theater showed a multitude of different films including news films from Pathé Weekly (6) which were shown every Saturday and Tuesday and a feature film every Monday and Friday (40)(49). Documentaries were popular with the “original moving pictures” of the Ohio floods in 1913 being predicted to be a “record breaker” by the Morning Enterprise, though that may have been because the footage was shown for only one day (29). Another popular documentary was done of Oregon prison life and shown throughout Oregon in 1912, making its way to the Grand Theatre on May 8th and 9th of that year (30). Local scenes were also seen at the Grand as a film of salmon fishers on the Willamette river in Oregon City was shown at the theater in 1913 (44). This film was shown as part of a “specially elaborate program” designed to celebrate the Grand’s fifth anniversary in 1913 (45) and filled the house by giving local residents an opportunity to see “‘movies’ of a scene they knew so well” (46). The theater itself had a brief brush with fame as actor Frank Lanning visited the theater and spoke with the audience on May 13th and 14th in 1912 (31). Another visitor to the theater was one Carl List who had been held “prisoner on a submarine” and spoke of his experience to an audience in 1916 (11).

      
             Marketed as a family-friendly theater, the Grand generally avoided controversy though it appears to have been fined for a certain showing. The issue must not have been serious as Oregon City’s Morning Enterprise advertised the next day that the theater was going to “break the law again today by showing how Bettie Becomes a Maid” (18). This must have been an unusual occurrence as there is proof that Schram engaged in self-censorship as he did with a showing of The Kreutzer Sonata in 1915. Schram advertised the showing as being for sixteen and up but said that he would take a vote from the audience and if they thought it appropriate for children, he would allow patrons under sixteen (7). In 1916, however, the patrons of the Grand Theatre were forced to contend with the question of “what is art?,” as the Oregon City Courier put it, when the film The Warning showed the “nude forms of several of the actresses” (13).
Being the small-town theater that it was, the Grand was often at the center of community events and quite frequently going-away or birthday parties for Oregon City citizens would not be complete without a trip to the Grand Theatre (22). In charity work, the theater served as the location for a 1912 fundraiser done by the Oregon City High School to benefit their athletic program. This performance would include high school vaudeville acts in addition to the usual movies (25)(26). In 1912, another smaller-scale fundraiser was done to help Mrs. Anna Snyder who lost her eyesight and, like the high school fundraiser, it was a success (34)(35). The Grand was so much at the hub of social life that in 1912 there was even a twenty-five dollar incentive offered for the first couple who was willing to get married on the stage of the theater (28).
Advertisement for the Grand (""The Morning Enterprise,"" April 5, 1912, page 1. Historic Oregon Newspapers)It remains unclear whether any Oregon City couple went for this unique opportunity to start their marital life. The theater was connected to many local events as well and often had deals in which theatergoers were given five-cent coupons to the nearby Poultry Show or vice versa when in 1908 visitors to Oregon City’s “Market Day” were given free tickets to the then newly opened Grand Theatre (3). Other handouts included a “fine sugar shell” which was given to every third lady attending the theater on January 22, 1913 and fans, also for the ladies (47). Additionally, there is an indication that prizes and souvenirs were given out every Wednesday (42). One “prize day” offered particularly hefty prizes with three 15-pound boxes of candy given away during a 1PM showing and six 15-pound boxes given away each during the 8PM and the 9:30PM showings (28). Another interesting prize that can only be testament to the agrarian roots of Oregon City was 20 spring chickens which were given away at the Grand in concurrence with Tabor and Green, a “colored musical act,” in 1912 (32). Children often got free presents too as courtesy of the theater management (33). Perhaps the most interesting strategy to gain clientele was the “Raffles” scheme (see: Raffles of the Grand Theatre). Citizens of Oregon City were told that if they could identify a mysterious “Mr. Raffles” while holding a coupon as evidence that they had attended the Grand Theatre the night before, they could win ten dollars (36). This of course led to several instances of mistaken identity (37)(38) before Mr. Raffles was finally identified as a “Mr. Brown” (39).
These methods to attract a larger audience only go to show that Oregon City had quite a few competitors for the Grand Theatre when it came to entertainment. The earliest competition was with the Electric Theater, which was the first to show moving pictures in the town, and later competition included the Arcade, Liberty, and Star theaters. For some time it seems that the Grand Theatre stayed ahead of the game and was the first theater in town which could afford to raise prices to 15 cents without losing customers but perhaps it was this stiff competition that drove the Grand Theatre to closing down. It is unclear as to why or when the theater closed exactly but the last recorded articles are from 1929 and with the Great Depression then looming there could numerous reasons as to why the theater shut down.

Hawthorne Theatre,707 1/2 Hawthorne Avenue (Today @ 2021 SE Hawthorne Boulevard),"Portland, OR",45° 30.73333' N,122° 38.70000' W,1915-01-01,1915,1934-01-01,1934,About 120,"Phil Carlin (Manager) , Current Owner: Chuck Nakvasil","The Hawthorne Theatre has had a long history of film exhibition. The theatre became known as the Hawthorne in 1915 and remained that way until 1934 when it became the Star Hawthorne. The building still stands today on 20th and Hawthorne as the Cinemagic Theater. The theater itself has always been a single screen theater, which shows the value that it has had in the community of East Portland to have survived the test of time. 
Front of the Cinemagic, formerly The Hawthorne Theatre.A part of the long-lasting success of the theater can be attributed to its location in the residential part of East Portland. According to Sanborn Maps, the theater was originally located next to a corner drugstore, a 21 car parking garage and numerous homes. The small community was able to walk to enjoy the theater's attractions whenever they wanted to. There was an instance where the theater put on a night for St. David's Episcopal Church in the area, offering entertainment acts such as films from the Mutal Film (absorbed by RKO) and variety acts. A man by the name of Henry I. Fisher, the owner of the Fisher, Thorsen & Company, a paint supplier, donated to the theater for the benefit of the church. 
 
Sanborn Fire Insurance Maps, Theatre's Location in the Portland Neighborhoods. 

 

 

      
            Taken from Historic Oregon Newspapers, the local theater exhibited a documentary production of the San Diego Exposition from 1915 which was a big news story at the time on the American West Coast. This allowed the community to get a visual experience of what was going on down south. 

The theater did not always have a successful exhibition experience on the east side of Portland. At some point between July 1st and September 1st  of 1915, the first year the theater was open, there was a robbery that resulted in the loss of two pianos used for theater exhibition.

According to The Film Daily, there was a fire that had resulted in $1,500 (about $28,000 today) sometime around 1936, when it was the Star Hawthorne, but still referred to by national scripts as the Hawthorne. The manager at that time, Phil Carlin, believed that the fire was started to distract from the robbery that had taken place within the theater as well. 

The theater itself is a testament to how history can be lost due to time and by the people documenting the history during the times. From 1916-1924, the theater was not listed in the Portland City Directory for each of those years. For an establishment that has withstood over 100 years of film exhibition in Portland (now known as Cinemagic), it is interesting that the directory did not list it for a decade.

Hippodrome Theater,Corner of SW Broadway and Yamhill,"Portland, OR",45° 31.11667' N,122° 40.80000' W,1916-05-11,1916,1922-12-31,1922,Unknown,"Ackerman and Harris, Tom Conlon, W.W. Ely","The history of the Hippodrome on SW Broadway and Yamhillbegins on April 11, 1916, as the theater was previously known as the Orpheum, gets bought out by the Hippodrome vaudeville circuit run by Ackerman and Harris. It was transformed into another Hippodrome theater and would become a part of the Northwest circuit of the company. The manager from December 12, 1916- April 17, 1917, was Tom Conlon. From April 17, 1917, until information runs out for theater the manager was W.W. Ely who was previously the manager of a Hippodrome in San Francisco but was transferred to Portland. While the theater began as a vaudeville only location as films began to gain more and more in popularity in American culture, it transformed into a film only theater. Searching through paper archives it can be seen that while there were standard programming bills and newspaper advertisements that demonstrated the collection of films that would be shown, there was a variety of other strategies as well. They would also have promotions and premiers that included the stars of the films and it would become a grand affair for the whole city. This is quite different from Portland today when there are very few premieres in Portland and celebrities rarely attend screenings in the city. 

There was also a variety of other events that were held at the theater including church masses and free shows for children to promote safety. One of the more fascinating aspects of researching the theater that also helped provide cultural context for the era was that in 1919 the theater added a garden to commemorate the conclusion of the first world war. It was a memorial to honor those who had fallen and was orchestrated by employees at the theater and not mandated by their owners. This detail helps add a human perspective to history and helps it come to life as a living history and not just words in a newspaper. There was also an article that had the manager W.W Ely describe how prohibition helped increase theater productivity and sales. The article does not explicitly mention the reasons for this, but one could assume that it was because of a combination of people needing more activities to participate in due to them not being allowed to drink, as well as more money available to spend on leisure activities. For some reason after December 31, 1922, the name Hippodrome Theater stops appearing and there is no evidence that the theater closed down or was sold.

      
            Going into this project I believed that conducting research that hasn’t already been studied would prove to be a daunting and disheartening task, but has actually proven to be quite enjoyable. Looking for specific items such as the seat numbers and fire map have proven quite difficult and the mystery of why the databases drop the Hippodrome is still a mystery I hope to solve, but when I am just gathering articles that describe the time period and the general day to day activities of the movie theater it is fascinating to learn. Quirky and strange oddities and promotions have proven to be the most enjoyable stuff to discover but also finding out how major historical events such as the First World War and Prohibition effected film going have proven to be the most striking. It demonstrates how films and the culture at large are always in a dialogue with each other and change depending on the social landscape. The Oregon Newspaper Database has proven to be the most helpful and most user-friendly platform for discovering new articles and advertisements for my theater. After discovering who the main manager was also helpful and I am in the process of discovering more about his background and how he ran the theater.",NA,"Sunday Oregonian, April 9, 1916, pg. 5, Oregon Historic Newspapers

The Hollywood theater had a unique logo. The style of the name was similar to that of the Hollywood sign, which is a smart stylistic choice. It not only makes the theater standout, but it also connects it to the allure of California. The fascination with celebrities and fame.

Jensen and John G. von Herberg, , Managers: Walter E. Tebbetts, E. E. Marsh","The Hollywood Theater was built in 1926 by  the very successful Claude Jensen and John von Herberg.1 The duo hired Bennes & Herzog, architects from Portland, and they spent $500,000 (a fortune at the time) to build the luxurious, beautiful theater, the exterior of which is in a Spanish-Colonial style and the interior of which is modeled after the Roman baths of Caracalla and the famous basilica of St Pietro. This magnificent theater instantly transported every viewer that walked into it and carried them into magical Spain and Italy. The theater is filled with beautiful colors and architecture. In fact The Hollywood Theater was considered so grand and beautiful that in 1983 it was registered on the National Register of Historical Places. The Hollywood is one of only three movie houses in Portland that are on the National Register.2 Not only was The Hollywood Theater extremely beautiful, but it also played notorious new films that audiences were excited to see.  For example, on opening night the first film being shown was More Pay, Less Work, a short, silent film written by Peter Kyne.3 The Hollywood’s showing  was the film’s world premier, and audience members flocked to the theater in excitement. A subsequent film  shown in August was another silent film entitled The Plastic Age, a college story about the process of moulding boys into men and featuring Clare Bow and Donald Keith.4 While The Hollywood Theater showed mostly silent films,  they also featured vaudeville acts and hired a variety of other acts to come and perform. One such performer was Gene Dennis, who was booked at The Hollywood for a week and who the Hollywood Theater promised would “mystify audiences all over America”.5 Gene Dennis was one of the most famous people of the 1920s and the best known psychic-performer in America at that time. The Hollywood Theater being able to book the then-famous Ms. Dennis  evinces the reputation and popularity of the theater during that time. The Hollywood Theater was so renowned and popular that the entire surrounding neighborhood decided to change its name from the “Rosewood District” to the “Hollywood District.”6 Subsequently, however, The Hollywood Theater had to do a lot of difficult, creative marketing work to remain as popular as it was in the 1920s. The theater used a lot of modern promotional strategies to maintain and move up in the theater world. For example, The Hollywood had their name placed in various real estate ads7 in hope that the viewer would a) want to live in that vicinity because it was close to The Hollywood Theater, and b) would go to the theater because they lived near the theater. These real estate ads also had the benefit of  introducing The Hollywood Theater to new and broader audiences who happened to be looking to buy or rent housing. In addition, The Hollywood Theater advertised when they were upgrading their technology to pull in people with their improved technology and audiovisual quality. In May of 1928, The Hollywood Theater advertised that “Movietone-Vitaphone programs will be offered,” making The Hollywood the only theater on the east side [of Portland] presenting this form of diversion.”8 With its beautiful architecture and design, its promotional strategies and its impressive programming, The Hollywood Theater started at the top of its game and was able to maintain its stature in subsequent years. After opening night, the Sunday Oregonian praised The Hollywood Theater, writing, “the daring colors—the wealth of decoration and appointments of the theater itself dominated the scene and inspired enthusiastic comments of admiration from everyone present.”9 Not only was The Hollywood Theater a magnificent, beautiful place filled with elegance and curiosity, but it also left a lasting impact on the neighborhood. To this day, locals and others still love The Hollywood Theater as much as they did at its opening in 1926.

      
            While researching The Hollywood Theater, I found it much easier to find information than when I was researching The Ideal Theater. I think this is so because The Hollywood Theater is still open (and therefore of continued interest), while The Ideal Theater is long-closed. Also The Hollywood Theater was much more grand and therefore popular when it first opened than when The Ideal opened.  So The Hollywood Theater received a lot more press and more articles were written about it. To research The Hollywood I primarily used Newsbank.com and found articles about the theater’s Grand Opening, the programming at the theater, updates about the theater, and reviews of the experience at The Hollywood. I also used sources from the Oregon Historical Society, which is where I found a lot of my pictures of The Hollywood Theater. Then a couple of days ago, when I thought I was done with my research, my friend Emily from class texted me a link and said “Idk if you found this yet but here ya go.” I opened the link and it was a National Register of Historic Places Registration Form for the Frances Building and Echo Theater. At first I was confused but then I kept reading and realized a couple pages down the form was comparing The Echo with The Hollywood because The Hollywood is one of three theaters on the National Register. Once I realized it was on the National Register, I went to the National Archives catalog and found The Hollywood’s National Register of Historic Places Nomination Form from 1983. This find gave a lot of useful and descriptive information about The Hollywood that I was able to use in my write-up. I was also able to find the Sanborn Fire Map, but it took a lot of digging and patience, to help locate the Hollywood Theater.  When I began this process I didn't know The Hollywood Theater’s original address (or if the address had changed at all). All I had to go off of was the supposed current address of the theater, which was the corner of NE Broadway and Sandy Blvd. in Northeast Portland. To determine the exact address, I started by looking for Sandy and Broadway in the indices and then I moved on to adjacent streets. I was having no luck until, once again, Emily saved the day and showed me a picture she had taken in the Special Collections section of the library (which i probably should have just gone to in the first place). It was a picture of addresses of theaters in 1927, and there was The Hollywood Theater with its address shown as Sandy Blvd. and 41st Street (not Broadway). Once I had the correct address it was easy to find The Hollywood Theater’s location on the Sanborn map. I also had a difficult time figuring out who the owners and managers were because I found the names of many different owners and managers. I wasn’t sure which reports were correct. Also it was difficult to figure out who owned The Hollywood Theater because in the 1920s they used strange words to describe these higher up positions like “direction of Jensen and Von Herberg” or “presided over.” Those terms are not very specific so I was not sure if those terms really meant “owner,” “manager,” “contractor,”  or something else. Because of this I wasn't able to figure out exactly who built, managed and owned the theater. While I found that researching The Hollywood Theater was easier than others in most regards, some things gave me difficulty like the Sanborn map and past addresses of the theater, but I eventually found them with patience and persistence. And then this past Friday I made a sojourn to Portland, in part to locate and view The Hollywood Theater (I also visited the Bagdad Theater inside and out). The Hollywood Theater was as beautiful and majestic as I had read, and I understood why its allure had stood the test of time.","Home to a large and coveted collection of kung fu films, Projector collection includes a Kinetescope, or Edison projector, made during the silent era, The only theater in Oregon that can screen 70mm film","“Grand Opening!

            According to the Oregon Encyclopedia, John V. Houston started his opera house on Main Street in Klamath Falls in 1897. He operated it as a multipurpose event and community space for many years. The Opera House was more than a theater for film as it became the hub for the city’s arts & culture. Events such as dances, club meetings, sports events and church services were offered here. This wasn’t just a place to catch your favorite film but hypnotists, boxing matches, traveling circuses and more premiered here.
Klamath Falls Evening Herald, Feb. 27, 1908, p. 4. Historic Oregon Newspapers.There were around 250 seats at the Houston Opera House. Although, at the peak of its success with the introduction of vaudeville performances (melodramas, minstrel shows and more), nearly 700 people were trying to squeeze into the Opera House at one point.

The most notable motion picture showings found at the Opera House include The Battle Cry of Peace and The Escape.  Additionally, there were many performances of famous people at the time: Actors like Mary Pickford appeared on the big screen, screenings of D.W. Griffiths films were often features, many musicians performed… The list goes on and on.

Houston's Opera House was honored as the first theater in Klamath Falls with a Vitagraph machine. The Edison Projectoscope was used from 1901 onward, thus giving Klamath Falls and its citizens access to big titled names like Teddy Roosevelt’s Rough Riders in Cuba. This gave this small town in Oregon a look to another place in the world, because they may never get to see it in person themselves.

J.V. Houston was often found to try new ways of advertising. He was an innovator from the very beginning.

The early 1900s weren’t shy to have their blunt racism showed. At the time, it wasn’t defined as “racism” but just as the way things were. But looking back, it is interesting to see “blackface” widely advertised and accepted.

Houston's Opera House was destroyed on Labor Day 1920, due to a building across the street (Houston Hotel) going up in flames. The fire resulted in 13 deaths and much damage to buildings on Main & 2nd street.

During the early 1900s advertisements where what made or broke entertainment facilities such as theaters. When looking at the advertisement above the most important thing to take away is that when theaters made updates in order to please the audiences it needed to be heard and the best way to do so is in an advertisement. Adding a 700$ sound system in order to completely submerse the audience is the equivalent to how IMAX is today. Not only was this the next big thing in the film industry it is what separated the good theaters from the bad. Competition is everything, especially when the cost to rent and run film in such a large piece of property is so high. How theaters spent there earnings had to be very precise because if the theater down the street renovated the seats to be more comfortable what's to say that numbers at the Hub would be lower?

 

      
            The Article Below: 

The first page of the semi weekly news reporting that a fire had occurred in the Hub Theater. During the early 1900s fires where common in theaters and often where the reason why theaters went under. What happened at the Hub was 5000 feet of film, a moving picture machine, a rectifier and motor where all damaged. No lives where lost but the owner at the time C.T. Searl stated that there was no insurance on the items and the result of that would be closure until the following Friday. These small fires that destroy the very thing that makes theaters money is one of the biggest reasons why they would go out of business. Thank goodness no lives where lost and injures had, as that would have turned into a large lawsuit for the Hub.

When talking about how advertisements make or break a theater the most important aspect is catching the readers attention when they flip through the newspaper. The tactics used in the advertisement above where not uncalled for as the whole goal was too print big letters that are bolded in order to take up the most space possible. Not only does the Hub theater focus on the format of this adviretisment to be simple and robust they sneak in a comment about ""children"". This was a common tactic to use being if parents wanted to see a film then they could bring their kids and wouldn't  have to leave them home with a baby sitter. When looking at the bigger picture it would end up being more revenue for the theater in the long run as more people are attending films.

Ideal Theatre,801-1/2 Thurman Street,"Portland, OR",45° 32.13333' N,122° 42.06667' W,1912-01-01,1912,1927-12-31,1927,300,"Conrad LeBlanc, George C. Maple, H.C. Phelps, H.C. Phillips, C.E. Yeager","The Ideal Theater was built and designed in 1912 by Emil Schachts & Sons and commissioned by the original owner, Conrad LeBlanc. By the end of 1912, the theater opened for business as a silent movie house and was extremely popular for its small neighborhood feel with only 300 seats (8). The Ideal Theater used extensive advertising in newspapers around Portland to spread the news of their exquisite theater. For example, in The Oregon Daily Journal, the Ideal Theater advertised its movie house as having some of the best lighting and seating in Portland, “giving each person in the audience an equal chance to hear and see”(1).
The Ideal Theater, Image Courtesy of Cinema Treasures.Unfortunately, the Ideal Theater did not remain in the best shape and did not have the best of luck. In May of 1918 the Ideal Theater experienced a fire in the projection room as a result of a film reel breaking during the middle of a film (2). Luckily, however, W.H. Meyers, the film operator, was in the room and was able to put it out without major damage. Then in January of 1922 the Ideal Theater was involved in a burglary and was robbed of some of its precious equipment and films (3). Some of the more valuable pieces were, however, recovered after two boys confessed to the burglary. 

      
            While the Ideal theater did experience many setbacks, it also was very successful in bringing in popular movies and always filling the seats of its theater for any show, through its advertising in both the local and larger newspapers. For example, in August of 1915 an ad was placed in The Oregon Daily Journal for the film The Diamond in the Sky, by Roy McCardell, claiming the film was “a remarkable achievement in motion picture art (4).” Another ad was placed in The Oregon Daily Journal in January of 1917 for the film Pearl Of the Army, which was directed by Edward José (5). Then in March of 1922 an exquisite ad was placed in The Oregon Daily Journal (6) for Paramount Picture’s 10th anniversary, letting the public know that Paramount would be playing their best films at certain theaters in Portland, and that the Ideal Theater would be one of those. The Ideal theater also dabbled in putting on benefits at the theater, and on March 17 of 1915 the theater ""ran a set of highly entertaining films for the benefit of the Chapman School."" The money from the night was put in a fund at the disposal of the parent teacher association for them to use towards the school and the night was a smashing success (7).

After its opening in 1912, the Ideal Theater continued to flourish. In 1927, remodeling construction began on the theater. The theater’s facade was remodeled to give it a nicer look, and the entry room’s ceiling was vaulted so the theater would be able to add a sound film projection booth. Right after this remodel, however, in 1927 the theater’s name was changed to the Senate Theater, and the name Ideal Theater was never to be seen again. However, The Senate theater only lasted for a few years before its name was changed again to The Bluebird theater in 1930.

Webster, Small & Whiteside Bros.","The Idlewile Theater in Corvallis Oregon was opened on September 3, 1910 and quickly became a rather popular and well regarded destination for entertainment in town. The original proprietors C. E. Barclay, J. A. Rycraft, and W. M. Webster initially invested ""several hundred dollars"" to ensure the theater opened with attractive decor and quality machines for motion pictures. The Idlewile's opening night was a great success and prompted said proprietors to install an illuminated sign in front of the theater to attract even more people. Large ads describing the week's programming also started showing up in Corvallis's Gazette-Times newspaper soon after the Idlewile's opening as another promotional strategy.

The Idlewile's programming consisted of a mix of motion pictures and a wide range of various live acts. Films were shown in-between performances of the featured live act and would be changed every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday. Most accounts from the time noted that the films were typically of average quality while the live acts were fantastic and the main attraction of the Idlewile. Another common comment from the time was that the theater was a fantastic value for the money. With tickets being only 10 or 20 cents and audiences being shown around three hours of entertainment, one newspaper article even went as far as to say that the amount of value was ""too much for the money"".

The theater's first live feature was the Wright Comedy Company which came along with the construction of a new stage to accompany their performances. This comedic first feature led to the Idlewhile becoming known for showing comedies and other interesting engagements beyond their normal, everyday film showings. Educational features also made appearances at the Idlewhile. Eli A. Smith, an Alaskan traveler, showcasing images of Alaska with his team of sled dogs as well as lectures about Custer's Last Stand being two notable examples.

The Idlewile would close on January 23, 1911 and be acquired by new management, Small & Whiteside Bros. The theater would remain closed until February 21, 1911 when it was reopened with a new floor, new chairs, and under the new name of the ""New Star"".

In the small town of Klamath Falls, Oregon were three motion picture theaters. One of which was the Iris theater. The first mention of the theater appeared in The Evening Herald on July 31, 1911. The Evening Herald was Klamath Falls' first newspaper that started in 1908. It can be assumed that the Iris existed before 1908 but there are no sources, when researched, that could prove otherwise. At the time of the first existing printed record of the Iris, the small theater was owned by J.B. Gammon. Mr. Gammon (as referred to in research(Evening Herald, August 18, 1909)), was incredibly involved in the community, providing numerous occasions for citizens to see shows while other community events occurred. One of the most talked about occasions, aside from the Community Event (Bargain Week), was a giveaway of $5! Tickets for adults were 10 cents and 5 for children during the short time the Iris was in business. While the CPI Inflation Calculator can't go back to 1908, the adjusted inflation for $5 in 1913 would be $131.98 as of February 2020.

      
            Changing Hands

On May 8, 1911, it was reported in The Evening Herald would be taken over by new ownership. This was not the first time that the Iris changed ownership however, but because of spotty coverage from The Evening Herald, it is currently up in the air in terms of whom the second owner was. It is also unclear when exactly the new owners, A.V. and L.C. Wishard took over the Iris because of unclear regards to timing. In the article, the author writes, ""The new owners will take charge of the theater the first of next week"" (May 8, 1911). With all the excitement of the Iris having new ownership, the Iris was never mentioned again after May 25, 1911 (Evening Herald, May 25, 1911), which means it probably shut down. The irony of this excitement is all of the boasting that the ads did after being acquired by the Wishard brothers about how incredible the theater and programs were. ",NA,"“CPI Inflation Calculator.” U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, www.bls.gov/data/inflation_calculator.htm.

Sherwood,"In some of the first newspaper advertisements, the Isis theatre began advertising for a program, Vanity Fair, which was three reels long and played for only two days. The theatre also promoted the fact that it had live music from Charles King (music director) as well as an “extraordinary solo” to go with the program. Starting in February, the Isis started promoting that they would carry four reels, or “4000 feet of the best film made.”

Beside each film that was listed, they named the company that had created the film. With every showing, the Isis always had an illustrated song to go with the programming. The Isis did try to get involved in the community by holding a showing for the boys of La Grande. Multiple ads were put in the newspaper to promote this showing. The Isis was only around for two years, and near the end of its two years, it moved locations and let readers know that it would be changing names. The Isis theater became Sherry’s theater, owned by B.M Sherwood still.

Admission for children was 10 cents while admission for adults was 15 cents. The theater had matinee showings weekdays from 1:30 P.M. until 7 P.M. in the evening. On Saturdays and Sundays, the theater provided continuous showings from 12:30 P.M. until 11 P.M. in the evening. On Sunday, May 17, 1931, the theater published a program, left, for that week’s daily feature films. The theater played The Spoilers on Sunday and Monday, Be Yourself on Tuesday and Wednesday, The Sea God on Thursday and Friday, while playing one feature on Saturday, Trailing Trouble, and previewing the upcoming “coming soon” feature, Devil’s Holiday, that would play the following week. With each feature film listed, the theater chose to include an actor or actress’s name from within the film in order to entice patrons into the theater and to see the show. The theater also boasts in this advertisement that the theater is equipped with RCA Sound. Additionally, this advertisement provides information to its reader about the showtimes, “Continuous Shows Sat. and Sun. 1 to 11 P.M. Daily Mat. 1:30, Eve., 7” with admission costing 10 cents for children and 15 cents for adults (Medford Mail Tribune, May 17, 1931, p. 2).

The advertisements for the Isis theater are usually found in the bottom corner of the pages of the Medford Mail Tribune. The ads include the name of the theater, in capital letters, and the location of the theater “East Main Near Bridge” printed below, in a box. The ads were typically simplistic, with the name of the film playing at the at theater that week and, perhaps, an image depicting a scene or actor from the film. Additionally, the ads for the theater included the admission fees of 10 and 15 cents. In addition to the advertisements ran in the Medford Mail Tribune, the theater has “A large and attractive Neon sign in colors, with moving electrical effects, announcing the name of the new theater,” and it “extends out from the theater entrance on East Main street, and will assist considerably in enticing the crowds to that section of the city” (Medford Mail Tribune, Mar. 29, 1929).

Isis offered both vaudeville and motion pictures with music and effects. The Isis interior was luxurious by having comfortable seating, clean spaces, and an electric system of ventilation to have a nice cooling temperature inside during warm weather. Harry Williams was the manager and his goal was to provide the best entertainment experience for audiences that attend Isis. Williams partnered with Edward C. Marshall to have the Marshall Road Show perform for the Isis theater opening. The Marshall Road Show was an entertainment company with classy vaudevillians who are very outspoken in the press and recognized in various cities they have toured. This was a big deal for Medford vaudeville go-ers to check out Isis theater and get familiar with. 

Isis theater opened on May 21, 1910, with The Great Marshal Road Show vaudeville performers, music performances, and the latest motion pictures. The ticket admission prices were 15 and 25 cents. Seats were not reserved and seatings were assigned on what audiences paid for.

The advertisements for the Isis theater were usually found in the Medford Mail Tribune newspapers on page four. The ad for Isis had a big and bold font inside a box with information to catch readers' attention. The information in the box provided a list of moving pictures featuring playing tor vaudevilles that will perform on stage for that night. As well as feature films or performance review articles to attract readers to Isis theater.

The earliest documentation found was around June 20th in 1913. This theater was used as a landmark, and often was used as a relative landmark to point people in the correct place. Per example, in the Independence Monitor, there was an advertisement for a special twenty five cent dinner2. The advertisement says “Look for the Sign on Main Street next the Isis Theatre.” Although grammatically inaccurate, this advertisement is a testament to the theatre’s importance in the small town. 

 

      
            Furthermore, this theatre was not only an entertainment space for Independence, it was a meeting place. For example, on June 20th, a notice ran in the Independence Monitor detailing a Farmers’ Union Meeting on the 28th of June3. The notice details the events unfolding during the Union meeting, starting off with a lecture and ending with a musical performance. Besides being a landmark building and a communal meeting place, the theatre provided visual entertainment to Independence. Below is an advertisement for the “World’s Greatest Feature Civilization” on Wednesday, September 27th in 19164. What is interesting about the newspaper clipping is the advertised price. “Prices same as in Portland” points to this idea that this film will provide a similar high quality experience in this small town theatre.

            One interesting promotional strategy to bring in audiences and to combat a local fly problem was to offer a free movie ticket for an envelope containing 50 dead flies (see Michael Aronson's ""Swatting Flies and Winning Chicken's"" chapter in his book Nickelodeon City for more discussion about this and other novel promotional stunts).

It opened on during Thanksgiving week in 1918 in a space on Main Street in Medford formerly occupied by the Star theater.

The Liberty's advertising tended to focus on star quality, placing importance on the actors over the film itself. In most advertisements found for upcoming films the first thing or the largest thing on it would be the star or stars of films instead of the title. There is a trend of phrasing the byline to suggest that the actors are going to arrive and perform at the Liberty in person. There is also a focus on this being a modern and higher class environment featuring the most modern technology and the highest demand films.

            When this theater opened it advertised the best equipment and music. There is an emphasis on exclusivity with their slogan “Where those who know will prefer to go” implying that certain aspects of the theater will only be known to those who are possibly worthy. They also hoped to draw in audiences by emphasizing the emerging Hollywood star system in a lengthy list of stars that would be featured in upcoming films at the Liberty.

The ad to the right predominantly features a headshot of the “charming prima donna” Dorothy Dalton, drawing in the public with the promise of being able to watch the victories of this lovely woman. With the title “Fatty Arbuckle At The Liberty” there is an implication that he will arrive in Medford and perform live at the Liberty. One has to read the rest of the article to realize that the event is only a film screening.

This is another film that works to bring in a more high-culture crowd. This time they advertise the name of the film as much as the star, given that Carmen is also the name of a popular opera, a pastime synonymous with high-culture.

The theater was originally given the name ""Liberty"" by Jensen and Von Herberg in 1917. Jensen and Von Herberg were a pair of entertainment business owners who owned the Columbia theatre in Portland as well as multiple theaters in Seattle and Butte, Montana before they purchased the Liberty. Notably, Jensen and Von Herberg were interested in purchasing the theater to increase the size of their circuit as early as 1915, however, Portland censorship policies on films deterred their interest (Oregon Daily Journal, 1916). Still, it was not long until the former proprietor of the theater, E.F. James, surrendered his lease on the building which was then known as ""The Broadway Theatre"" and Jensen and Von Herberg took charge. Ultimately, the Liberty Theatre would be one of Jensen and Von Herberg's most prosperous ventures as the Liberty was Portland's largest theater devoted exclusively to motion pictures at the time. The pair would hold onto the theater until the late 1920s when the theater was once again sold and renamed “The Music Box,"" (Vogel).



 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

      
            

Between 1916 and 1918, the Liberty Theatre had three different Wurlitzer organs installed. Many of the early acts were accompanied by the musical renditions of local professional organ players who would play mainly at special events which often happened during the holidays. The Liberty hosted the most prominent films of the silent era and paid for advertisements on a near-weekly basis which document the theater’s programming. Jensen and Von Herberg were known for incorporating promotional strategies with community involvement. For example, Charlie Chaplin’s “The Kid” was the first film in which Chaplin acted, directed, and authored. This six-part comedy partially fueled Chaplin’s meteoric rise to stardom and “The Kid” is still regarded as a silent-film era classic. This significance was clearly apparent to the owner of the Liberty Theatre in Portland, Oregon, who extended the film’s stay for longer than usual because of its appeal and success. In order to advertise the extended showings, the Liberty Theatre adopted a grassroots marketing strategy that employed a local five-year-old named John Ross White who was paid to dress as Jackie Coogan and wander the streets of downtown Portland in order to promote the film. White was accompanied by his father who was dressed as Charlie Chaplin. Jackie Coogan, who co-starred alongside Chaplin, was one of the first child stars in film history at a similar age to the youngster named John (Oregon Daily Journal, 1921).",NA,"

The exact date in April of 1925 for the grand opening is unknown, however there are some gaps in the information for Astoria. It can be speculated that this theatre was alive before the fire however more research would have to be done to find out if that is true. The theatre was built by the firm Bennes and Herzog who are “known for their extravagant movie palace, combined elements of Romanesque and Italian-Renaissance styles to construct Astoria’s ornate 700-seat vaudeville stage and motion picture theatre” (1). The theatre showed vaudeville acts, silent movies and brought in famous bands and people like Guy Lombardo, Duke Ellington, and Jack Benny (1). This place was booming during World War II with its main attraction being vaudeville acts for almost 25 years (1).

The liberty theatre had acquired a Style F “Special” Wurlitzer, opus 949 in 1924 but in 1930 it was taken out and sent to the Mayan Theatre in Denver, Colorado (2). When it was removed they left and inscription in the empty organ chamber wall, which was found during a renovation which read, “Organ removed Sept. 16-30 shipped to Denver Colorado to Mayan Theatre"" (2). In the 1930’s, Liberty Theatre gained another Wurlitzer, a 2/4 Style B which came from the Astoria Theatre across the street. The organ was later moved in the late 1940’s when Bill Blunk purchased it and it was move several more times following (2).

            The Liberty Theatre has seen many up and downs, after decades its reputation was in decline, around the 1980’s the landlord, Edward Eng let the theatre go (1). No heat, no cleaning, sticky floors, broken seats, stained screen, and peepholes in the walls of the women’s bathroom (1). After suffering for many years, in 1992 Forrester, Michael Fosterm and Hal Snow formed a nonprofit organization to save the theatre (1). This group was able to raise $1.3 million and purchased the theatre in 2000 (1). Finally, $7.5 millions in renovation, they reopened the theater in 2005. To this day the Liberty is still considered, as it was in 1925, as “Astoria’s living room” (1). The Liberty Theatre has been restored in 2006 and it has made a major impact on the economic development on downtown Astoria (3). This theatre is one of the only 1920’s vintage motion picture palace restored to its original decorative architecture in Oregon (3).

Coble / Manager/Owner 1924-1941: Byron A. Stover / Manager: Herbert Law / 1921 Owners: Sparks Amusement Company / 1923 Owners: Claude Smith & O.M. Whittington / Current Owners: Tom Cirello and Marilyn Cirello,"The Deschutes County of Oregon was established on December 13, 1916 due to a surge in population of the area. Two new lumber mills were opened in the area and working class people flocked to central Oregon, the fastest growing population in the entire United States at the time, in hopes of securing a job. However, because the area had previously been so small, there was a serious lack of entertainment. To help solve this issue, T. Monty O’Donnell, long-time resident of the area, financed a state-of-the-art theater in downtown Bend, Oregon named Liberty Theater. With the help of architect Edward H. Keane and $15,000 from O’Donnell, Liberty Theater opened on July 29, 1917. 

The Liberty Theater was located at 849 NW Wall Street Bend, OR, making it a prime location of Bend. The 500 seat Liberty outshined O’Donnell’s first theater, the 84 seat “Bend Theater,” the only other theater in the county.  Liberty was designed by Keane to feature movie and vaudeville shows. Leading up to Liberty’s opening in July 1917, manager Ward H. Coble announced that the first movie to be shown on opening night would be “Broadway Jones” with George M. Cohan; the silent comedy film is considered to be a lost film today. Only top films would be played at the theater including films from film companies like Paramount Pictures and Universal and charge an attendance fee of 15 cents for children and 25 cents for adults. The theater was thriving and the people of Bend were selling out most showings. It was not until about six years after opening day, that the theater would see its first decline. 

The only competition that Liberty Theater had was another theater in Bend called “Grand Theater.” In 1921, both theaters were sold to Sparks Amusement Company for $20,000. The company decided to upgrade both theaters drastically. However, only two years later in 1923, Sparks Amusement Company sold both theaters once again to Claude Smith & O.M. Whittington under the management of Byron A. Stover. While the upgrades that Sparks Amusement Company made in 1921 helped Liberty, a new and better theater named “Capitol Theater” would be the ultimate downfall of Liberty Theater.  By the 1930s, Stover was now the owner of both Liberty and Capitol. Stover tried to improve Liberty by installing a high fidelity system in 1936to be on the same level of Capitol but without success. The Liberty Theater closed in October of 1941. 

While the name “Liberty Theater” was no more, the building at 849 NW Wall Street Bend was converted in the 1950s for office and retail space that was once the orchestra area of the theater. However, by the 1980s, the balcony area of the theater was being used to show films under the name “Fine Arts Theater.” Then in the 2010s, an art collective named “At Liberty” was opened in the building. The collective operated out of the building until 2020 when it dissolved into another local art collective company. Since 2020, the building has been under construction for a “rehabilitation” to return the theater to its original historic design by the current owners Tom and Marilyn Cirello.

Liberty Theatre,"N. 3rd Ave. & E. Main St., Hillsboro, Oregon","Hillsboro, OR",45° 31.38333' N,122° 59.16667' W,1916-02-17,1916,1922-12-29,1922,Unknown,Unknown,"Based on the newspapers that were available from the Historic Oregon Newspapers, the Liberty Theatre was in operation from February 17, 1916 through December 29, 1922. The theatre was most likely open longer than mentioned due to the popularity and amount of advertisements released. According to The Hillsboro Argus from 1916, the Liberty Theatre was formerly known as the Grand Theatre. The grand opening night of the theatre was on Friday, February 18, 1916. Unfortunately, I was not able to find the address, number of seats, and owners. Because of the amount of advertisements for the theatre and because of how small Hillsboro is compared to Portland, one could assume  the address did not need to be mentioned because many people already knew where the theatre was located.

Many of the advertisements for the Liberty Theatre showcased a range of program information. From The Hillsboro Argus in 1916, it was being promoted that there were to be “vocal solos by Alice Mae Phelps, Sidney Drew in 15 minutes of laughter, vitagraph comedy, hearst vitagraph weekly, live up-to-the-minute news, 4 piece orchestra” as well as Charlie Chaplin being mentioned in a “brand new 2-reel comedy.” It seems as if many of the programming and promotional strategies used by the theatre owners were solely focused on the audiences. There were a wide range of films and entertainment to be shown that would attract many audience members.
The Hillsboro Argus, February 17, 1916, page 2 

      
            In 1916, The Hillsboro Argus stated that one of their showings was the “absolutely first run in Hillsboro,” attempting to appeal to the crowds and showing audiences popular entertainment to keep them interested in continuously attending different showings and becoming loyal to the theatre itself. 

The Liberty Theatre was interested in being the best option for people and made it clear, through their newspaper advertisements, that they were offering the best deals and had the best programs. For example, in the 1921 Hillsboro Argus,  their 10-reel program was said to include “The Silver Horde,” as it was posted in bold letters that their prices were 10 cents, 15 cents, and 25 cents. In order to stay above their competitors, they mentioned in smaller print that the feature they were showing “played throughout the state at 35 cents and 50 cents,” proving they had the better option.

Popular with the time the theatre was open, Audrey Munson was mentioned in many of the advertisements. It was common for one single page of a newspaper to have multiple advertisements for the Liberty Theatre. According to Stephen Heyman in a Vogue article, it was argued that “Munson was America’s first supermodel.” It is likely for people to pass her on the streets in New York City without even realizing it because there are so many statues of her. Munson began her career working “as a Broadway chorus girl, became famous for her ideal ‘Grecian’ proportions.” She then pursued acting as she was advertised to be shown at the Liberty Theatre without a vulgar scene.

​​​​​Overall, the Liberty Theatre was popular enough for locals because no address had to be included in the advertisements for people to find it. As I was searching for a map to showcase where the theatre was located, I found a Sanborn map that displays two theaters, one being the Ventian Theatre, and the other is assumed to be the Liberty Theatre. Although I do not have an exact address of the Liberty Theatre, I believe it was located in between East Lincoln and East Main Street on North 3rd Avenue in Hillsboro. According to The Hillsboro Argus, the theatre also made sure to keep up with technological innovations by replacing their standard projector with the “newest improved motion picture projector.”

The Lyric Theater opened January 2nd, 1909, taking over from the previous theater the Orpheum, presumably bought out from the previous owners. Records indicate the Orpheum being announced as sold December 31st, 1908, to the Lyric Theater Company. This initial announcement places heavy emphasis on seat rearrangement, general improvements to the facilities, and new management promising ""first class attractions.""

Although there are no sources of definitive evidence, it can be speculated through the large list of amenities that ongoing operation required a large amount of overhead that could not be cleared in a timely manner, leading to the short-lived nature of the Lyric.

Lyric Theater,"203 N. Main St., Prineville, Oregon","Prineville, OR",44° 18.13333' N,120° 50.85000' W,1911-03-30,1911,1968-01-01,1968,220,"L.C. Morgan, W. J. Pancake, Van D. Brink","The Lyric Theater in Prineville, Oregon had a tumultuous start to its existence. The first stationary moving picture show opened in Prineville in 1909, as the Emporium Electric Moving Picture Show, with manager Frank E. Brocius. It is likely that this predecessor of the Lyric was actually run by his wife, however, as can be seen in Figure 1. The Emporium was located in the I.O.O.F. building in downtown Prineville, very close in proximity to the future location of the Lyric (Figure 2). In September 1910, the Emporium was purchased from Mrs. Brocius by L.C. Morgan, who would become the most important figure in shaping the Lyric’s history. There were a few license-timing issues during the purchase, but by February 1911, Morgan’s theater was up and running as the Pictorium, showing mostly one reel dramas and comedies (Figure 3). 

Between February and March 1911, the name of the theater was changed once more, from the Pictorium to the Lyric. The Lyric officially opened on March 30, 1911, and would stay open under that name until its final closure. During the period of time between Morgan buying the theater and it opening as the Lyric at its permanent address, the theater got potentially relocated several times, to a Mrs. Maling’s “new brick building” and then to the Glaze building, which is likely where it ended up (Figures 4 & 5).

In the first few months of its operation the Lyric continued to show small dramas and comedies, along with Westerns. It often ran ads in the paper advertising specific films, and there was a regular “At the Lyric” section in the Crook County Journal. As it gained more popularity, however, Morgan became fully involved with the exhibition scene and began to show larger pictures. He quit his job at the forest service and made several trips up to Portland to learn about the latest in theaters and moviegoing. By the end of 1911 the Lyric was showing three-reel films, and in 1912 big production company pictures were regularly shown. In fact, Morgan wrote an ad personally urging people to go see one such film, Dante’s Inferno (Figure 6).

Morgan operated the theater to great success until 1916, when he and his wife moved to Michigan to be near family, and the Lyric was sold to a W.J. Pancake. Pancake was a seasoned theater operator, making trips to Portland just as Morgan had done, and got praise for the quality of pictures he was able to show at the Lyric (Figure 7). As an interesting tie-in to the recent pandemic, there are several theater ads from 1919 instructing people to wear masks and stay protected (Figure 8). In 1920 the Lyric got its first pipe organ. The theater continued to show big films and operated as the primary theater of Prineville until 1938, when Ken Piercy bought the Lyric and also opened the Pine Theater. He continued to operate the Lyric for a while as a B theater, but after a fire in 1968, the Lyric was permanently closed. It had been open for almost sixty years.

A snippet from the social section of the Ashland Tidings in 1915 shows the couple offering violin and piano lessons at their home studio (1). The theatre was remodeled and outfitted with the latest playhouse amenities including a large stage, raised ceiling, an indirect lighting system, and even a ""first-class ventilating system"" (2). The Lawrence's put together a six-piece orchestra, and it was known throughout Ashland that the Lyric was the place to be. They showed a variety of motion pictures and hosted local events that garnered to specific audiences. Monday afternoon matinee showings of children's motion picture plays (3) and women's auxiliary nights (2) are just a couple of examples.

      
            The Lyric was apparently not concerned with showing topical films (4), perhaps as if they expected it would earn a decent profit despite causing controversy. Other programming included popular, spectacle-oriented films with big budgets (5) and live musical performances (6). 

During the summer of 1915, the Lyric flourished not only due to its ventilation, but also because they quickly became known for their cheap prices and extraordinary flicks. They partnered with Mutual Masterpictures in order to ""represent the highest achievement in Motion Pictures."" These programs included films such as ""The Quest"", advertised as a large-budget masterpiece worth 50 cents. The theatre, of course, rather only charged 10 and 15 cents.

Moving Picture World, Jan. 27, 1917, p. 574. Media History Digital Library.Larger and grander than any of the other storefront operations in 1913, people traveled from far away just to come see a show at the Majestic. The theater was also home to live theatrical productions, opera, and vaudeville shows, as well as motion pictures. When films and live performances were occupying the theater together, a film would show at night and the live performers, occasionally students of the high school or college, would wait for the film to end and then immediately take down the screen and erect the set in preparation for their performance the following day. It would then in turn be deconstructed following the performance so the regular movie showings could continue. (3)

            One of the programming strategies the Majestic used included advertisements such as this one which states, ""Friday Matinee: For women only."" and later adds, ""No men will be admitted."" The upper advertisement claims that Edna Wallace Hopper is 62 years old but looks no more than 19, and is there in person to answer questions about how she ""preserves her youth."" By bringing a well-known star to the theater, it helped attract an audience that might not normally attend the matinee.
Corvallis Gazette-Times, Sept. 3, 1917, p. 4. Newspapers.com.In 1917, there was a special election for measure 109, which was proposed to try and outlaw movies on Sundays. The Whiteside brothers, owning multiple movie theaters in Corvallis including the Majestic, published advertisements urging voters to vote NO on measure 109. This particular advertisement claims that the Whiteside brothers plan to show only the best films on Sunday nights, and if this measure was to take away Sunday movie times then the town would miss out of these grand films.

Also, the theater began to use taglines such as “It’s Different” in its advertisements (1).

As a promotion, the Majestic theater gave away free passes “to every Saturday matinee” for students in Douglas County who averaged “85% or over” in their monthly studies (2). That’s a lot of opportunities for free tickets! It is likely that the theater was trying to draw in more of a crowd, since children would often have to be accompanied by their parents, and the price of admission was higher for adults.
Roseburg Review, Dec. 26, 1914, p. 2. Newspapers.com.George Maple, owner of the Majestic in 1915, decided to play the “Fox program’s” reels for only 10 cents, because he felt audiences would not pay the full dollar (3).

            In February of 1921, films were outlawed on Sunday for all theaters in the Roseburg area. This article shares C. F. Hills’ (who at the time was the manager for the Majestic and the Antlers theatres) opinion that if his theater should have to close on Sundays then all other theaters that might open in the future should also be subject to the law to maintain fair competition. Other than that he resisted coming out on either side of the issue. ""I am willing to do what the public desires,"" Mr. Hill stated...""In my business I am guided by what the public wants and I am willing at all times to accede to the public's wishes. If it is the desire of the public that the theatres be closed, then I am perfectly willing to shut the doors of my playhouses on Sunday. If it is the desire of the public that they remain open then I am willing to continue Sunday shows"" (4).

It wasn’t until April of 1922 that Manager Hill rescheduled movies for his theaters to show on Sundays.

            The owners of the Antlers theater took control of the Majestic theater in June 1919. They called themselves the Globe Company (5). The Globe Theatre Company, which owned many of the theaters in Roseburg during this time, tried to standardize the prices for the Majestic theater. In 1919 at the Majestic, adult tickets cost 22 cents, child tickets cost 10 cents, and box seats cost 25 cents. In contrast, tickets at the Antlers theater were 25 cents for an adult ticket. 

The Majestic theater was refurbished by Ray Smith through the management of the Globe Theatres Company. The walls were to be painted with “typical Oregon scenes, in beautiful colorings”. The refurbishing of the Majestic theater also promised to have a “large new moving picture screen [so] all possibility of injuring the eyes is avoided”.

            Lawrence A. Goux (formally of New York) took over the Majestic and the Antlers theaters in 1923 (6). In 1927, ownership of the Majestic and several other theaters in Roseburg and the southern Oregon region were purchased and consolidated into a chain under the ownership of George A. Hunt Amusement Company (7).

During the 1918 Spanish Flu pandemic, the Majestic ran an advertisement with a message from the Oregon State Board of Health, that theaters would ""exclude all persons sneezing and coughing.""  

The Majestic, along with several other theaters in Roseburg, closed for a time in 1927 to help contain an outbreak of ""infantile paralysis"" (likely polio) (8). It re-opened on Christmas Day of that year, but seems to have stopped operating sometime in early 1928. No more ads for movies appeared after the new year, and in November a small news item ran in the local newspaper that the building had been vacated. The Rose theater opened in the same space in 1931.

Majestic Theater,739 SW Washington Street,"Portland, OR",45° 31.25000' N,122° 40.73333' W,1911-08-10,1911,1929-01-01,1929,"1,050","Edwin F. James, Frank Lacey","Portland, Oregon’s famed Majestic Theater was opened on the corner of Washington and Southwest Broadway in 1911. The theater was owned by Edwin Jones, a Seattle business man who moved to Oregon to pursue the exhibition industry. Though Jones was new to the area when opening the Majestic, he made quite a name for himself in the coming years, becoming known for his theater residing in the “same house, same location for longer than any other exhibitor in Portland.”

The Majestic also became known for being one of the first two theaters on the Pacific Coast to add live musical accompaniments to the silent films at this time. During this time, The Peoples Amusement Company monopolized on the film industry, leaving other theaters to compete for audiences. Edwin Jones’ rose to the occasion by introduce organ music playing to the silent films and launched the first organ music accompaniment on the same day at The Star (the theater across the street).

Mr. Jones became known to be a man that took pride in theaters and film. He put in a great deal of effort into pre-screening all films before showing them at the Majestic. Scenes that could be seen as controversial were cut from the film. Yet, other films that officials felt were controversial, such as the film “Sapho”, he found beauty and value in and had no shame in publicly fighting for the right to show it. Furthermore, he introduced unseen films to the Portland theater scene. Films such as “The Fall of Troy”, which was a two-reel film and cost $150 per week to rent – a large price to pay during this time.



      
            Edwin Jones was no doubt a businessman who shared the love of exhibition. Because of this, he was accustomed to spending the money needed to create a grand experience. He embraced the transition when nickelodeons and movie storefronts were no longer meeting the needs of the audiences and the development of movie palaces were born. Mr. Jones built The Majestic as a movie palace in 1911 for $62,000, seating 1,050 audience members. The Majestic was built in line with movie palaces that possessed grand architectural decoration and were meant to make the audience feel transported into an upscale, imaginative atmosphere.

Looking at historic theater marques, they are most commonly built as overhangs or canopies at the entrance of theaters that hold signage. These marques would draw attention, advertise the next showings as well and provide coverage for audiences waiting for tickets. What the Majestic Theater did with the architecture of their marque was quite unique. They took advantage of their corner lot and the foot traffic that took place at that corner by guiding the foot traffic through the corner of their building. By carving out the corner of Washington and Broadway and creating a covered vestibule they were able to create a cross section for shopper to now experience a gallery-like settling that displayed the current and upcoming acts and movie adds. While most theaters save the grand architectural details for the interior of these movie palaces, the Majestic was able to entice local shoppers or pedestrians by bringing the indoor experience, outside on this busy street corner. The theater lined the entire rounded corner with bright lights, drawing in crowds from all over.

Advertising was extremely important to Edwin F. James, and his manager, Frank Lacey (1). While showing a comedy feature by Mr. and Mrs. Carter DeHaven called Their Day of Rest, Frank Lacey took an ad from a newspaper in the film, and put it in a real newspaper. Quite the practical joke. Especially because the ad read ""A cook, $100 a month, every afternoon off, use of family vehicle on Sunday,"" These were tantalizing requests in 1919. $100 a month is a lot of money. In fact, a person applying for the job wrote, ""If I ever earned $100 a month, I don't know what I would do, but I am willing to try it and see."" This ad worked as people were contacting Majestic theater in every way they could to get this one of a kind job. Little did they know, Frank Lacey was playing a practical joke on them. The newspaper article snippet goes on to say that the ad had caused a lot of talk throughout the town. And Frank Lacey is quoted saying, ""It pays to advertise."" 

One can imagine what a staple this theater was in the community. Edwin Jones’ love for exhibition drew in crowds from all classes to enjoy film and live musicians for 18 long years before the theater closed in 1929. The theater was later bought and re-opened by Theater Artist Union.

Mears (Manager), Operated by Majestic Amusement Company","The Majestic Theatre opened on July 1st 1920 with nearly 500 modern opera chairs, carpeted isles, restrooms with running water, and elegantly designed light fixtures. This theater also had an automatic printing machine according to this article. 
Ontario Argus, 07/01/1920, p. 1This theatre was owned and operated by the Majestic Amusement Company, whose goal was to build a ""circuit of twenty-five theatres,"" and to ""please as many patrons as physically possible."" This theater achieved this by showing a wide variety of content in order to attract a wide variety of audiences in this small town like comedies, horror pictures, and live performances including music and theater. 

      
            In the process of researching this theater, I found difficulty tracking down the address. There was no mention of its specific address in historical newspapers in online databases besides that it was on the ""main street"" of the town. I turned to ""Special Collections"" in the University of Oregon Library in order to find a city directory. While I did not find a directory that included dates that may have shown the Dreamland Theatre property, I did learn that there were maps of Malheur County elsewhere in the library. I scoured said maps and met the same issue, the dates of the maps were not old enough to include the theater. Finally I decided to email the Malheur County Historical Society and send a message to the Ontario, Oregon Public Library. The historical society was able to provide me with photographs of the Majestic Theatre and another theater, ""The Dreamland Theatre,"" and the Public Library was able to share the addresses of both of these theaters as well as images of both.

The images of the theaters that were provided to me were dated in 1909 according in the Malheur County Historical Society, which conflicts with the dates of operation found in newspapers.

Paul, The Majestic Amusement Company","The Majestic Theatre opened its doors to the people of Ontario, Oregon on July 1, 1920 (1). This roughly 500-seat theater with three loges (box) seating areas. was the second theater to open in the small eastern Oregon town in the early part of the 20th century, eight years after the Dreamland Theatre. The theatre was established and owned by The Majestic Amusement Company which was an organization of entertainers and business folk of Boise, Idaho (2).
Majestic Theatre, Dates Unknown, Image Courtesy of Pinterest.By the time the theatre opened, the population of Ontario was a mere 2,039, which made competition between the two motion picture and entertainment establishments fierce. While the Dreamland Theatre had been the main attraction for nearly a decade, by 1921, just a year after the Majestic's opening, it was already dominating pages with large advertisements in The Ontario Argus. L.C. Mears, the manager at the time of the theatre's opening, was a strong believer that theater success was in large part due to extensive advertising as he had found many successes doing such that with the other 16 theatres in eastern Oregon that he managed at the time. His philosophy was the put the theater's name in as many places and sizes in the local papers as possible in order to fill seats on a nightly basis (3-6).

During the 1920s, silent films had developed into full motion picture productions, and the Majestic took full advantage of that by showing longer films in conjunction with vaudeville acts from the circuit in Idaho. The first film that was ever exhibited at the theater was a Mary Pickford film titled Pollyanna (1920). During the second week of the theater's time in operation, the programmers had already diversified their exhibition into a portfolio of vaudeville acts and longer multi-reel productions, smaller reel comedies and longer thrillers, and they even had a night of short comedy, feature production and a ""scenic"" (documentary short) (7-8).

 

      
            The venue was well equipped with the latest lighting fixtures and effects, fancy carpeting, a 500-light sign out front, an air cooling system, running water in the restrooms furnished for women and an automatic ticketing machine at the box office (much like what is still used today). The theater prided itself on its two machines that created ""a hundred percent more brilliancy"" to its luminosity. According to Exhibitors' Herald and Moving Picture World, the establishment used a Kolstadphone sound system (9). 

The theater became an integral part of the small eastern Oregon and western Idaho community relatively quickly. In 1922, the manager at the time H.B. Paul organized an event for the College of Idaho Glee Club to perform at the theater. This was exciting news for the townspeople of Ontario, who had undoubtedly read about the musical coalition and their successes performing across the state of Idaho. The programming of the theater offered its patrons more than just the large studio productions of the time period such as local productions that residents of the area found comfort in its familiarity (10-11). 

While the theater only lasted at the Majestic for twelve years, it was a critical establishment for historians searching for a glimpse of the past and how the people of a small town in the northwest of the United States enjoyed their days 100 years ago. It found success by being located in an industrial area of town for blue-collar workers to come to enjoy entertainment according to Sanborn Maps (12).

McDonald Theater,"1010 Willamette Street Eugene, Oregon","Eugene, OR",44° 2.91667' N,123° 5.58333' W,1925-05-07,1925,2022-06-21,2022,"1,250","Aaron Harding McDonald, Donald McDonald","A. H. McDonald - Theater OwnerAaron Harding McDonald was the proud visionary and owner of the Lowell Theater. This Twelve Hundred and Fifty seat gem was a culmination of Mr. McDonald’s life work, as the previous owner of the three Eugene theaters: The Heilig, The Castle and The Rez. With an unforeseen death on March 26, 1925, A. H. McDonald passed away just weeks before the Lowell Theater’s grand opening. His estate of approximately $94,000 was inherited by his wife and only son, Donald McDonald. Donald was appointed the administrator of the Lowell Theater and A. A. Rogers, W. T. Gordon and L. I. Raywer were appointed appraisers. 

              On May 7th, 1925 the entire town celebrated the grand opening of the Lowell theater and remembered their adored A. H. McDonald. Towns persons including the Messer’s, Schaefer’s, those associate with the McDonald family in the theater enterprise: Frank L. Chambers (President), W. W. Calkins (Vice-President), Bruse Brundage (treasurer), all who represented the Eugene chamber of commerce: McMorran and Washburne and many friends and family all signed a petition to change the name from the Lowell theater to the McDonald theater. With the support of Major Lowell Smith, United States Army, (who A. H. McDonald named the theater after), the name of the theater officially changed to the McDonald theater on grand opening day. 

              The Eugene Guard wrote an article expressed that “the spirit is felt immediately as one enter the new Lowell [McDonald] theater. Here the ambition was to present a theater that would be ideal in every way to present first of all an atmosphere that would put a person in the most receptive mood for genuine enjoyment.” This was achieved through the Romanesque style. Roman arches by the Byzantine reach clear up to the coved ceiling. Inside the real surprise comes as a spacious foyer greets you, heavily carpeted, specially designed iron chairs, console table, tapestry, and a huge mirror on the wall, four beautiful ivory chandeliers hung from grilled rosettes on the ceiling, charming arched entrance to the main floor, backed by silk plush drapes. Double ramp from the foyer to the balcony is one of the most charming features of the new structure.

      
            The McDonald Theater was the largest theater of any other theater in Eugene, with the finest, most modern equipment of any state or northwest. The entrance was long, with a spacious lobby and a wall ‘neatly decorated’ with four large framed futurist masterpiece paintings. The auditorium was lit by light baskets on each side near the ceiling which included three colors and white in each basket; resulting in beautiful lighting effects. There was a garden beneath each organ chamber, with the Wurlitzer organ which was twice as large as the one at the Rex theater. The spacious stage was finished with grey blue drawn curtains.  

McDonald Theater continued to be a highlight in the The Eugene Guard through the 1900’s, filling up pages of the newspaper with upcoming events. The paper announced on May 5th, 1925 that the opening play was “Madame Sans Gene” starring Gloria Swanson and Warack Ward, which was the first location this production was performed. 

On June 3rd, 1927 the paper had 4 adds on one page. One was an announcement was of a look alike contest for the famous actresses Laura LaPlante,  Marry Phlibin, and Marian Nixon. The winners of the contest were given a trip to Portland and ride on the Universal float in the American parade on June 17th. Another add announced that the famous Miss Marylin Mills and her horse will be making an appearance the following Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday. Miss Mills was one of the most famous women in motion picture at that time, starting her career as a double for other famous actresses such as Mary Pickford, Pola Negri, Florence Vidor, Jetta Goudal, Greta Garbo and many others. Another add shown on the same page in the Eugene Guard that day was showing of “Gilda Gray Cabaret” at the McDonald Theater. The movie ran from 1pm to 11:30pm and entry was “regular price”. Other acts that day include Delbert Faust, Eugene’s own Broadway star performing matinee and night in New York and a special showing of “Screen Test” featuring president Arnold Bennett Hall.  

              Throughout the years, the McDonald theater had under-gone multiple restoration projects and owners that encourages the theater to thrive. But in early 2001 the theater struggle to maintain business with new big box theaters and decided to close its doors. The final feature shown was “Cast Away”. 

Fortunately, in September 2001 the McDonald theater re-opened as an all-ages music venue. The theater underwent several months of painting, plastering and retrofitting to make it into the music venue it is today.  The first band to play was a reggae group named “Burning Spear” and the theater continues to play mainstream reggae, hosts private weddings, high school proms, and local children’s stage performances. The McDonald also caters to non-profit organizations and encourages the community to take advantage of this beautifully maintained historic landmark for events, celebrations, lectures, and fundraisers.

The building was built to suit for the theater with a budget of $35,000 by Mr. George S. Smith, who already owned other Portland theaters2. Thomas and Thomas Architects designed the building, which also houses several other retail spaces3. It was built for an audience of 675 people, and was designed to be fireproof2. The building has not been significantly altered since it was built, with the exception of a new marquee by Simonton and Steele in 19503.
Moreland Theater Marquee. Portland, Oregon. May 1982. Image from the City of Portland Historic Resource Inventory.The Moreland Theater is a small neighborhood theater, so they have been very involved in the community by hosting local events and fundraisers. Two significant events have been the Rose Festival Junior Court and an annual children’s fundraiser. There have also been numerous church events, including Easter services held in the theater4. Since at least 1932, the theater hosted the Gamma Phi Beta Annual Benefit for children5. It was planned by the sorority alumni, but the theater donated the use of the theater space for the event. It was a fundraiser for their programs that benefit underprivileged children. The theater played kid friendly movies, including Mickey Mouse, and it was mentioned that there may also have been a variety of performances from the children6. The event was held each spring through at least 1963, and had guests each year from local children’s groups7. The Junior Rose Festival also held its annual event at the theater, where they announced the prince and princess of the court at the event for kids and teenagers from the local area8.

      
            The theater has gone through several changes in ownership, but has not changed the theater or its name. It was opened by Mr. Smith and at some point, was bought by the Multnomah Theater Corporation, which also owned other theaters in Portland. Then in 1928, Kenneth Cockerline and his wife took over ownership of the theater9. They owned it for a significant period of time and were influential in Portland movie industry because both were involved with the Board of Censors. Mr. Cockerline was appointed to the Board of Review in 1942 and eventually became Chairman10. His wife continued operation of the theater and was appointed to the Board after his death in 194611. Sometime before May 1983 it was taken over by Avalon Theatre Corporation, who currently own the theater12.

After their purchase, they built a completely new building constructed by the Bickner brothers for $16,000. It was a modern marvel for the suburb of Multnomah and the papers even said it matched the luxury and accommodations present in Portland. Under their management, they showcased travel films from around the world and Illustrated lectures indicating that they catered to a higher class crowd. The theater saw an increase in profits after their purchase and began the theater’s history with a strong start.  

In 1914 the Multnomah was sold to Mr. McCredie and Mr. Phillips and they immediately began making architectural and internal improvements to the location. He added an addition to the theater that expanded its seating capacity as well as a new furnace for air conditioning for the winter and even a new projector in 1917. Program and events under McCredie’s management including charity fundraiser contests, events, and benefits which raised thousands of dollars for the community. His venture into the suburb of Multnomah was to escape the stingy censor boards that were present in Portland and hoped a location outside the city center would provide more freedom in the films he could show.

      
            In 1927 the theater was bought by Bob White who was an important and influential theater owner across Portland whose most famous theater was the Bob White Theatre after himself. In 1928 there were two major developments in the theater under Bob White’s leadership. The first was that he sold the theater to be a part of the Universal Theater Circuit. They retained the name Multnomah but were owned by Universal and showed their films until the Paramount decision, which resulted in the Multnomah returning to independent operations. He also installed a sound system that helped modernize the theater and bring it into the new age of talking motion pictures.

The last known manager was Paul Forsythe who owned the Blue Mouse Theater in Portland and operated until 1954. The Multnomah fell victim to multiple fires and was ultimately condemned and unable to continue operations. Today the location is a gift store as well as a frozen yogurt shop. The Multnomah was integral to the suburb of Portland and was a gathering place where people could comfortably enjoy quality pictures",NA,"""Electric Theatre Changing Names"" St Johns Review July 28, 1911, pg 3 Oregon Historical Newspapers

Winstock is the general manager of the theater as well as the National Amusement Company and stated that he has dreamed of opening this theater for three years prior to its opening. The property of this theater was owned by the Farrel Investment Company and eventually was acquired by the National Amusement Company. In many news stories about the National Theater it was often described as the best theater on the West Coast. This was due to its ventilation system and amazing decoration. In one news story, it states, “By simply moving a lever the temperature can be changed to whatever degree is desired and the air is maintained at all times by an approved system” (1). The idea of a thermostat was very exciting and the public loved it. The programming at the National was always described as the best films out there. They also talked about the expense of the film which was something I hadn’t seen before. Using the idea of the film costing a lot of money as a promotional strategy seemed to work for them. In one ad for a Charlie Chaplin film called “A Night Out” it stated, “At great expense the management has secured this feature comedy until and including Saturday night. Thousands requested it” (2).

In one ad, there was a list of films being shown both local and feature and there were also musical performers all in one day, “It’s worth more than 10 cents” it stated(3). In addition to using the expenses of films as a promotional strategy, the National also used flashy ads to grab attention. Most ads were clad with a star border and was usually shaped like an interstate road sign. This caused the ad to stand out amongst other square-shaped ads with no flashy boarders (4). 
Advertisement for National TheaterSomething interesting about the National is that it had a children’s playroom in the basement of the theater. This room included “sandpiles, spades, toys, dolls, rakes, shovels, swings, chutes, hobby horses, dining sets, Teddy bears, dogs, and similar utensils calculated to delight the hearts of the youngsters of Portland”. This area was described as a place where mothers could leave their children (since there was a maid present) and enjoy the show and come check on their children like they would an umbrella or jacket (1). 
Children's Playroom DescriptionOverall, it seemed as though the National was a beloved theater during its time while open. However, in 1916 it was bought by Morton Cohn (5). He changed the name to the Strand Theater and stated that Vaudeville would be shown.",NA,"Sunday Oregonian, 1 Nov. 1914, P18, https://oregonnews.uoregon.edu/

One look at the dates of operation of this theater will surely raise an eyebrow. What could possibly run a theater out of business in a mere 29 days? 

A deserving finger can be pointed at theater proprietor, S.S. Range. Mr. Range opened the Nickelodian in the Hodes building on Willamette St. April 1st, 1908. A mere 11 days after this grand opening, Mr. Range opened his second theater, the Dreamland Nickelodeon. Albeit there is nothing wrong with this, the Dreamland was located in the Coleman building - another location on Willamette St. Not only was Mr. Range competing with himself now, there were numerous Nickelodeons already located on Willamette St. such as the Electric Theater and The Orpheum. Such close consolidation of businesses will always be difficult, but the spreading out of assets between two locations is incredibly challenging.

A large article featured an upcoming event at the Novelty theater: a soprano by the name of Mrs. Johnson. Mrs. Johnson frequently performed in the Dreamland theater in Eugene, Oregon.

The Odeon Theatre was known when it opened as one of Portland's ""Big Four"" theaters. All four theater houses were under the management of The People's Amusement Company and were marketed as the city's biggest and best places to view motion pictures. The other three theaters included in Portland's ""Big Four"" were the Star, the Oh Joy and the Arcade.(4) The Big Four theaters in Portland were all known for showcasing a variety of unique performance art including film screenings of different genres, musical/vocal performances, all-day feature shows, etc. The Star Theatre was known as being the ""biggest and best"" of the Big Four theatres in Portland at the time.(5)

Other than moving pictures, the Odeon was known for other forms of live entertainment and spectacle as well, including lectures from prominent society members. One of these events included an ex-convict named George Sontag who was freshly-released from prison for an infamous train car robbery who lectured at the Odeon in an ""exceedingly interesting"" program that included backgrounds of ""beautiful illustrations"" warning spectators of the evils of careers in robbery and theft. (3) Just as other prominent theatre's under The People's Amusement Company's production like the Oh Joy, the Odeon Theatre was known for showing a variety of different genres in film screenings. In June of 1910, the program featured a Western Drama, an Industrial Feature, a Pathe Feature and a Musical Performance in Vocal Form.

Green","The Oh Joy Theatre in Portland, Oregon was a perfect venue for the picture loving public in the early 20th century. The Oh Joy Theatre was owned by Harry Holmes under the People's Amusement Company. The theatre shows various forms of entertainment and is located on Morrison Street near Third. In mid-February 1910, the Oh Joy Theatre featured the program entitled ""Taming A Husband"" and a unique art film imported specially to the Oh Joy Theatre from the Pathe Factory in Paris, France entitled ""Ouchard, The Merchant"". A vaudeville acrobatic presentation of ""Harry Brothers, the Acrobats"" was equal in quality the renowned first class vaudeville house productions of the time. Motion pictures debuted with regular appearances on vaudeville program bills in the Portland area during the turn of the 20th century. (4) The Portland vaudeville theatres of the time strived to become more like the big-time east coast vaudeville circuit.

One of the typical trends of Oregonian's (including the familiar names of George Baker, Calvin Heilig, Fred Merrill, Edward Shields) in this pursuit was the inclusion of the family unit in the entertainment environment, an idea that served the east coast circuit with profitable returns. Another trend of the Portland circuit was to show vaudeville in theatres that serve liquor that were often thinly disguised gambling joints. Several instances of filmmaking during this period in Oregon made use of commercial firms for advertisement or promotion. After vaudeville in Portland developed for a few years, demand grew intensely for a first class vaudeville theatre, and the Portland area would get its very first on the 20th of November, 1904. On the orders of Proctor's, Keith's and the Orpheum, Considine opened Portland's Grand Theatre (formerly Cordray's) which is the largest, finest and most heavily financed theatre west of Chicago. Old and New World views of the time were on display in the theatre's presentations and Oh Joy's own impressive orchestra accompanying the talented baritone balladist of the house named Al Saither was a very popular attraction. A show known as ""Haba Haba"" was a rousing hit in in 1910 for the Oh Joy Theatre. (1)

The promotional strategies used by the Oh Joy Theatre included weekly announcements detailing the new programs available to local spectators, as well as showtimes. Other promotions related to the Oh Joy include lost and found reports (one specifically citing a lost set of false teeth) and advertisements concerning prices and typically the Oh Joy's current program of three to five shows. The Oh Joy Theatre opened at 11:00 am in the morning and ran until 11:00 pm in the evening, the entire program bill changed every Wednesday. (3)

Further and deeper research in a wider variety of fields will hopefully supply me with more direct information about the audiences who regularly attended the Oh Joy. In the years of success for the Oh Joy Theatre, photoplays and ventriloquists, and short films were all regulars on the program and shown in the attractive and comfortable theatre space that had become very popular among picture-loving audiences. (2) In December of 1911, The Oh Joy Theatre held its Amateur Night on Friday evening, declaring ""all amateur's admitted"" and mentioning of the possibility of prizes. The film and/or performance genres that were shown at the Oh Joy were known to range from Comedy, Satire, Drama, Industrial Novelty, Amateur, Acrobatics, Musical, Indian Stories, or Educational.

The Oregon theater began to buy space to run small blurbs promoting upcoming films, in addition to continuing to run small box ads on multiple pages of the papers. The papers also record specialty events taking place at the Oregon, such as lectures, traveling magicians, and the occasional vaudeville act. Some of these specialty shows were benefits for local organizations, or given for free for the purpose of education.

Meyers’ department store in Salem had many commercial and advertising tie-ins with the Oregon theater. A 1916 Meyers’ ad for a competition urges readers to vote at the ballot box located in the lobby of the Oregon. The prize was a gown chosen from the Meyers’ inventory (1). The Oregon also hosted Meyers’ Spring 1916 fashion show, drawing a crowd of hundreds to the venue (2, 3). The theater, which had been open about a year at this time, probably benefited most from the arrangement, and hosting the event helped the Oregon establish itself as a civic center in Salem.

            Around 1919 Oregon theaters in general were widely using lobby displays as a means of advertising. Charles Kupper used such displays frequently at the Oregon, including this spread to promote Paid in Advance, a September 1919 Universal release (4).

In 1921, with the murder trial of Roscoe “Fatty” Arbuckle in full swing in Los Angeles, Salem theater owners jointly agreed to a moratorium on Arbuckle’s pictures as long as he was accused of murder. “Of course we won’t show Arbuckle pictures here,” was Charles Kupper’s statement. Frank Bligh, owner and manager of several other Salem theaters, was “equally emphatic in his assertion that Arbuckle’s pictures will not be shown [in Salem] as long as he is charged with murder” (5).

In 1924 Thomas Grindley, a projectionist at the Oregon theater, created “animated posters” to show in the theater lobby. Although the construction and mechanism of these posters is unclear, the posters showed actors moving and interacting with each other, and the idea was revolutionary enough to warrant an article in First National Franchise (6).

      
      
  
          
            This is a 1928 advertisement for fighting at the Oregon theater. Fighting was actually a large form of entertainment during time period; which is still accurate. In addition to this fight the theater had a charity fund attached to it. This entices more people to attend and to donate. A tactic which is still used, and proves to be helpful. The advertisement makes it seem like a very anticipated fight. It also suggests the theater has been putting on fights for awhile. It’s possible Oregon theater was the main place to go and watch fights.

They had recently spent over $4,000 remodeling and expanding the space formerly occupied by the Folly theater.

Bryan and Watson invested in an aggressive promotional campaign for their new theater during the summer of 1915. They ran regular, large ads in the Eugene Daily Guard to announce upcoming shows, and used the effective “beautiful baby voting” contest to attract families to the theater.

The Oregon presented a program that was a typical mix of feature-length narrative fiction films, along with non-fiction shorts, comedies, and newsreels. One week in July 1915, for example, moviegoers could see The Wild Goose Chase, Physical Training in the French Army, and a selection of Paramount travel pictures. Admission was 5¢ and 10¢.

The Oregon contracted with Paramount Pictures to be the exclusive exhibitor of Paramount movies in Eugene.

            In July 1915, the Oregon hosted the locally made film The Stolen Pie, which featured many Eugene citizens. The Stolen Pie was not unique to Eugene. In fact, it followed a formula of itinerant filmmaking in which a small production outfit moved from town to town in a region to make the same story over and over again with local townspeople as the cast. The films were typically sponsored by one of the town's theaters which would then have an exclusive right to show the movie. Theater owners were practically guaranteed ticket sales as people came to see themselves and their neighbors on the big screen. The Stolen Pie was produced and screened in Klamath Falls and Medford, as well as several cities in the Midwest.

            Despite all of these efforts and the financial investment they had plowed into the theater, within two months of opening Bryan and Watson gave up and closed the Oregon. They leased the theater to the management of the Rex and the Savoy, and it continued under different ownership through 1919.

The Oregon continued to be a stalwart member of the local movie house scene, showing popular features such as The Spell of the Yukon (Burton King, 1916) and the sensational documentary Cannibals of the South Seas (Martin and Osa Johnson, 1918).

The last ads for the Oregon theater appeared in late December 1919, and nearly a year later the theater was remodeled and re-opened as the Castle.

Built concurrently with the adjoining Weatherly building, the theater cost somewhere between three-hundred and five-hundred thousand dollars (13) to build though the Film Daily reported its cost at six-hundred thousand (20) and the Motion Picture Record at five-hundred fifty thousand (6). Both the Weatherly building, which at twelve-stories high was considered to be one of Portland’s earliest skyscrapers (3), and the theater were owned by George W. Weatherly who commissioned their building (13).
Walter E. Tebbetts (Courtesy of the ""Motion Picture Record,"" circa. July 30, 1927)
      According to tale, Walter E. Tebbetts reportedly approached Weatherly and convinced him to build the neighboring theater alongside the building (13). Tebbetts, by then, was an experienced theater manager (6) who had managed Chicago’s Italian Opera House before moving to Portland in 1909. His first Portland theater was the Empire Theatre in East Portland which he ran in 1911 and by 1926 when he sold all his assets to the West Coast Theatres company he had in one way or another had a hand in twelve different Portland movie theaters including, but not limited to, the Grand, the Alhambra, the Montavilla, the State, the Highway, and the Hollywood (5)(13). After selling all his holdings, Tebbetts and his wife traveled the world visiting both Europe and Southeast Asia (5)(13). However, Tebbetts’ history as theater owner was never far from him and it was during these travels that he got the inspiration that later manifested in the Oriental Theatre (13)(15).
      Ground was broken for the building of the Weatherly building and the Oriental Theatre on March 21st, 1927 and despite predictions that the theater would be finished in the fall and opened on November 1st (2), delays in building materials resulted in the New Year’s Eve opening night (13). The theater was designed by the Thomas and Mercier firm (3) who also designed the Baghdad (5) and the Capitol theaters in Portland, the McDonald in Eugene, and the Egyptian in Coos Bay (13). The interior was designed by the sculptor Adrien Voisin who similarly designed the Orpheum in Los Angeles, El Capitan in San Francisco, and the Fox Theatre in Oakland (13). The theater was designed in a style reminiscent of Southeast Asian architecture particularly that of Hindu and Buddhist temples and Cambodia’s Angkor Wat. The lobby featured “two huge statues of Buddha” while tapestries and sculpted details reflected Oriental trends. Around the theater one could find various antiques which Tebbetts had acquired during his travels including several vases from India and French mirrors which cost two thousand each (3). Of all the ornaments featured, the most prominent were sixteen “sacred” elephants (21).

                  With its 2 PM December 31st opening, the Oriental Theatre was the largest theater Portland until it was surpassed in 1928 by the Portland Publix Theatre (now the Arlene Schnitzer Concert Hall) (13). Its neon sign was advertised as “the largest Neon electric sign ever built for a theatre” (6) and the red, blue and green lights were a “remarkably early example of so extensive a use of neon lighting” (13). Nevertheless, the “finest home of entertainment in this corner of the land,” (24) as the Oriental was called by the Sunday Oregonian was an experiment in a way. Prior to its opening, there had been no first-run movie theaters in Portland’s East side (6)(24) and certainly the Oriental Theatre, as a result of its size, location, and price-range, was an outlier in the context of the rest of Portland and even the Northwest.
      While Portland theater owners watched with wary eyes, the Oriental opened with a flourish to a street parade accompanied by dancing, a gala festival, and an unmatched program (4). Seats were sold at $5.50 each and among other attractions were several stars that “will appear in person, among them William Boyd, Elinor Fair and Madeline Hurlock” (7). The program was varied and the main highlights were two silent films, the biblical film “Moon of Israel” (4) and the comedy “the Girl from Everywhere” which were accompanied by the orchestra of Josef Srodka, formerly of Berlin’s U.F.A. Palace and the Portland Symphony, and Glen Shelley on the Wurlitzer organ (3). The opening night was a success and the theater filled to capacity with then Mayor George L.Baker among the attendees (13).
      Much like the opening night, the Oriental’s early years were successful. This success was sufficient enough that other East Side theaters began to feel the heat with S.I. Siciala, (whose Empire theater on Grand Avenue closed barely two months after the Oriental’s opening) stating that the Oriental had “cut deeply into his business” (22). This success may have been surprising to some as the price was rather steep in comparison to other Portland theaters with matinees costing 25 cents and evening shows 35 cents (3)(6)(14), yet people still came. The popularity may be in part attributed to the Oriental’s status as a “first-run” theater and each week Tebbetts introduced two new feature films with one debuting on Sundays and the other on Thursdays (3)(13). Even with two new features, Tebbetts booked so many films that he was forced to sell some FBO and De Mille films to the Orpheum (16). In general, the Oriental Theatre focused on showing films although these films were accompanied by live music and an organ. There is evidence that the theater for some time featured variety performances as the Oregonian reported in 1928 that Tebbetts was changing his policy to only including a few “brief novelties each week, mainly in singing and dancing” (1). The orchestra of Josef Srodka which had garnered so much acclaim in the early years of the Oriental would become practically obsolete with the addition of sound systems as the theater began showing films with sound in 1929 (13)(25). The theater had an excellent sound system, so much so that the Oriental was advertised on its marquee as “where the sound is better” (13).
      It was not all about making a profit though and the Oriental Theatre often had charity and benefit performances which served as fundraisers for various Portland nonprofit organizations (13). A charity event was given by manager Floyd Maxwell in 1932 during which “one thousand of Portland’s unemployed” saw a showing of “So Big” (12). There was also a focus on family entertainment with a Christmas matinee for children (19) who only had to pay ten cents (3)(14) and, to make attending easier for parents, the basement was turned into a free “Kiddies’ Play Room” which was supervised and had a “sand pile, merry-go-around, swing slide and a large assortment of toys” (3)(6)(8)(17).
      Manager and founder, Walter E. Tebbetts parted with the theater in 1932 (9) and it was leased to John Hamrick of the Blue Mouse Theatre between 1932 and 1935 (10)(23). Hamrick renovated the interior and reinstalled the marquee prior to re-opening the theater on May 6, 1932 (11). Despite the triumph of these early years, the size and location of the Oriental Theatre as well as the increase in television viewing led to its being sold in 1969. The contents of the theater were auctioned off on January 17th, 1970 and the building demolished in February of 1970 (13). Now where once stood the “Temple of Mirth,” (18) one of Portland’s finest entertainment establishments, one can now engage in the joyless task of parking one’s car (13).","Earliest ""first-run"" theater in Portland's East Side, Considered to be an ""atmospheric playhouse"" in ""East Indian"" style, Woman sues in 1928 after being ""dazzled"" by bright lights , ""Mister Antonio"" made 8 grand in a week in 1929, Marine Guard and war trophies used to advertise ""the Leatherneck"" in 1929, Audience tuned in to listen to ""Amos 'n' Andy"" on the radio in 1930, Featured on-site babysitting free of charge","1.

Greulich","The earliest mention of the Orpheum Theater in Pendleton Oregon comes from the East Oregonian newspaper on November 11, 19081. It remained open for seven and a half years, as it was sold and the name changed on April 22, 19162. With all the competition and frequent closing of theaters at the time, staying open for over seven years is quite impressive. The Orpheum was a fairly large theater, with 500 seats3. It went through three owners in the seven and a half years it was open, initially being opened by J.P. Medernach. When he fell ill and passed away ownership went to his son, Dr. Harry Medernach4. That was in 1914, and just a few years later Medernach sold the Orpheum to Frank Greulich, who only a few months later sold half of it and the name was changed2, 5. That was the last mention of the Orpheum in the East Oregonian although it stayed open with the new name for a time.

      
            The theater was located right on Main Street, with a prime location to entice an audience to come in to see a show6. There were more than just motion pictures shown at the Orpheum. It also offered things like illustrated lectures, vaudeville shows, and live orchestra performances7, 8, 9. In one article advertising the theater, it was mentioned that it would always “cater to the patronage and good will of the ladies and children” as well as “only the best of clean, educational, and pleasing films”10. It is clear that the owner wanted to attract all audiences and make sure the theater was an ideal place for families to go to. While the Orpheum was not involved in very many promotions, one way the theater made itself more appealing was by improving the area around it. When J.P. Medernach was the owner, he oversaw the addition of cement sidewalks and streetlamps outside, helping to add to not only the theater but the city as a whole11, 12. And later, when his son Harry was the owner, he improved the inside of the theater to add things like new seats and furnace heating13. These actions helped integrate the theater into the community and make sure people knew that it was a desirable location.",When the Orpheum was sold in 1916 the name was changed to the Cosy Theater and renovated to fit more vaudeville shows,"1.

However, they did feature some controversial films including works of D.W Griffith, Sapho, and Nightie Night. 

The theater featured a vast array of designs for films in newspapers featuring anything from graphic design, photographs, to sensationalist summaries.

These advertisements were featured next to each other in the Medford Mail Tribune. They both have a focus on the visual aesthetics, the unique graphic design for Broken Blossoms draws the eye.

Watch Your Step was Irving Berlin’s debut musical debuting four years earlier. This was not likely to be the original cast, but was still likely a live touring performance that made its way from New York to Medford.

This advertisement and this article were published in the same paper on the same day. The article addresses community concerns about the film, defending the morality of it claiming that Nightie Night  is “absolutely inoffensive” and “clean in spite of the fact that it is funny”. This defense of a film is not a regular occurrence in the Mail Tribune, so the question is why did The Page feel the need to defend this film?

However the page took a risk and showed it in the conservative environment that was Medford, Oregon in 1917.

The theater would work to maintain good relations with the community, giving them what they want. It was common for theaters in the area to only show a certain film for a few days in a row, then they would shift over to a new film.

From the ad at right, it is clear that there was much variety in the Palace theater's programming, including comedy films and live performances. The theater advertises a two-reel film (E. Lubin’s The Power of Silence) in conjunction with a program of four other films. Interestingly, the director’s name is listed for this film, but the theater simply provides the title and a description for other films in the ad.

The Palace went through a number of different owners and managers as different people tried to make a go of it in Roseburg's downtown entertainment landscape. Six months after opening, a large ad appeared in the local newspaper announcing new ownership. In May 1917, the theater changed hands again and re-opened as the Liberty.

            By 1916, audiences had become intrigued by movie stars. Theaters took advantage of the star system by including names of popular actors in their advertisements when their films came to town. Here, the Palace theater promotes that they are showing a Charlie Chaplin “two-reel famous [comedy],” yet the ad does not even say which film is playing. This reiterates the promotional trends regarding stars in the early 1900s.

Often, early theaters helped promote other local businesses. In this newspaper advertisement, the Palace theater is listed as a place where postage stamps were sold. As this ad was run in December, perhaps the theater hoped patrons would come in to purchase stamps to send their holiday cards and also decide to watch a film.

As of October, 1913 the Palm was boasting in the Portland Daily Journal that it offered 600 seats for its motion picture shows. This seems like an incredibly lofty claim after examining the Sanborn maps of the theater’s later incarnation, the Hawthorne Theatre in 1924, which shows the theater to be a small sliver of the block it takes residence on.
The Palm Theatre Opens. Oregon Daily Journal, 22 Oct, 1913.But what if it is not a false advertisement? I like to imagine those early days in the Palm: an incredibly stuffy room filled with big hats and ruffling tobacco smoke, with a noisy projector in the back and damn near 600 people packed in, sweltering from the body heat regardless of the temperature outside. That’s something else the Sanborn map indicates, a severe lack of conceivable ventilation as the bulk of the theater lays beyond a narrow hallway, crammed behind stores fronts and a corner drugstore.

The Palm (contrary to its name) was not an extravagant looking theater from the outside. It was very much a local neighborhood spot, that worked with churches and local youth. By 1914, an article in the Oregon Daily Journal was already calling the theater the Hawthorne, as it describes an exhibition from director Sam C. Jagger in which local neighborhood kids star in their own film that recounts “Coaster Auto Races” from the previous weekend. Can you imagine being a young newsie in Portland’s eastside at the time? One weekend you get to participate in this cool coaster race, and the next weekend you experience it all over again as you watch yourself on the silver screen being honored on the winner’s podium.

 

      
            

The Palm Theatre, in many ways, is a ghost. The exact date it opened is unclear, seeing as there is virtually nothing remaining from the early 1900’s to establish it ever existed. In fact, I would have been at a complete loss concerning this theater if I had not discovered it quickly changed names to the Hawthorne Theatre not long after it opened. How did I find this out? I cheated. I looked at the website “Cinema Treasures” and found it was progenitor to the Hawthorne and today’s CineMagic Theater. I am glad I didn’t rely on that website too heavily, however, because while it was right about the lineage, it got some dates wrong. For instance, the site claims the palm opened in 1914, and later changed its name to the Hawthorne in ’15. However, the earliest primary sources I could find on either incarnations told a different story. The Palm was opened, as I talked about in the beginning, as soon as fall 1913—potentially months earlier. And if the Palm became the Hawthorne in 1915, then why does the article from 1914 refer to the Theater as the Hawthorne? The obvious answer is because it had already changed, possibly as early as summer 1914.","Neighborhood Theater , Changed Names (Currently CineMagic), Still Operating","""Reward for Information."" The Sunday Oregonian, 31 Oct, 1915. https://oregonnews.uoregon.edu/lccn/sn83045782/1915-10-31/ed-1/seq-32/print/image_669x817_from_2952,119_to_3740,1081/

Johnson, November 1920 at the Pantages Theatre, Portland, Oregon, The Oregon Historical SocietyImpresario and entrepreneur Alexander Pantages opened his eponymous theater in late December 1905 at Fourth & Stark in downtown Portland in the space formerly occupied by the Liberty Theatre. From the beginning he incorporated movies into his programming. Along with the vaudeville comedians, jugglers, and trained dogs, ""The Biograph"" provided moving image entertainment to round out the program.

            The Portland location also featured the Pantages Orchestra and would exhibit films produced by The Pantagescope, including those of the animation and comedy genres. (Images A and B)

One article in the Oregon Daily Journal briefly mentions the “Children Song and Story Hour” event, hosted by the Mothers and Parent Teacher associations at the Theatre. (Image C)

Newspaper articles and advertisements directly published about the Pantages during the early 20th century were positive and painted the theater as an exciting, benevolent business. Portland’s Pantages, however, was oddly often named in front-page articles about crime and death. On Christmas Day of 1916, an article mentions the Pantages in context of a murder (Image D). Four year later on January 15, a peculiar incident involving the young Mr. and Mrs. Blankeney made headlines in the Oregon Daily (Image E). Mrs. Blankeney was described in the article as a “pretty cashier” who worked at the Pantages.

Near the end of the 1920s, the Pantages Theatre circuit as a whole began to receive negative journalism due to the criminal behavior of both its owner Alexander Pantages and his wife, perhaps contributing to the theaters’ abrupt end. (Image F)

It is documented in one of Portland’s African-American newspapers The Advocate that the Pantages had segregated seating. Tickets were offered to whites at various price points, depending on the quality of seat placement. Whites could purchase seats in the blacks section for the lowest rate. (Image G)

Although the Pantages circuit no longer operates today, there are three independently-run Pantages Theaters in the US, the most well-known being the Hollywood Pantages located in California.

      
      
  
          
            Advertising from this early phase promoted the venue as the ""best family theatre."" Ticket prices started at 10 cents, with  performances at 2:30 pm, 7:30 pm, and 9 pm everyday. The Pantages offered a broad selection of entertainment from vaudeville performances such as ""The Famous Shedman,"" comedic plays such as ""The Clerk and The Bellboy,"" and musical performances such as ""Techau Tavern Quartet."" Additionally, the theater offered a very diverse selection of performances from trained dogs, jugglers, comedy entertainment, moving picture comedians, and picture ballads. All of their performances were targeted towards providing family fun and entertainment, and by far, having the best vaudevilles possible. The majority of the Pantages theater's promotional strategies were focused on buying newspaper advertisements and promoting their performances scheduled for the week (with one large performance that takes a large portion of the ad and a few minor performances that take less space). Additionally, the majority of their advertisements focus on marketing themselves as the to-go place for the very best vaudeville performances. The placement of the ad is very close to other competing theatres such as the Marquam Grand Theatre or the Hellig Theatre. Throughout many newspaper advertisements, the same competitors are seen very closely placed next to the Pantages Family Theatre, so it's very obvious that they're all fighting for the same customers to go their specific theatres.

The theater moved to a more spacious location at 7th (Broadway) and Alder in 1911.

The Pantages vaudeville circuit ran across the western United States and Canada for several decades, earning notoriety for their original and enticing vaudeville performances. Programs often showcased tumblers, dancers, “eccentric comedians” and opera singers, just to name a few.

Paramount Theater,"1037 S.W. Broadway, Portland, Oregon","Portland, OR",45° 31.03333' N,122° 40.88333' W,1928-03-10,1928,1984-01-11,1984,4000,"Marc E. Bowman , West Coast Inc., Paramount Pictures","The esteemed Paramount Theater opened March 8,1928, on Broadway and Main Street in downtown Portland, Oregon. Originally named Portland Publix Theater, the theater was designed for viewing Paramount films, operated by Marc E. Bowman and West Coast Inc. The building was described at the time as a palatial (palace-like) playhouse and today is still one of the most iconic theaters building on the Pacific coast. The playhouse combined motion pictures and stage acts, such as featured music and dance that were complemented by background color and lighting effects. The theater was rather groundbreaking not only through its architecture but in its ability to merge audience classes by combining both stage performance acts with films.

Everything the Portland Publix theater did, they did in a big way. The newspapers were filled with ads exclaiming the Grand Opening, the architecture, and exhibitions. The Morning Oregonian described the grand opening as “an epoch in Portland” (a period of time that marks a notable event). The theater opened at 5:30 on a Thursday evening featuring two deluxe film showings and Alfred Short’s musical orchestra. Alfred Short, who was appointed the musical supervisor, had a long history in theater, symphony, and grand opening orchestra events. Short’s orchestra played “Faust” by Gounod to be the opening number for the dedication of the theater.

Designed to reflect the French Renaissance era, the theater was decorated with plaster ornamentation and artificial marble. Audiences were wonderstruck by the huge, majestic foyer, the roomy auditorium and the striking color combinations. The proscenium arches reached untouchable heights and were decorated in rich embellishment that framed the ceiling. With new and modern features, the theater included trick stages, orchestra pits and ‘novel’ lighting effect. Seating 4000 audience members, the Publix theater was the largest theater in the city, one of the largest on the Pacific Northwest and was known for its ornate features along the entire west coast. This theater was truly “an amazing institution of architectural splendor.”

      
            On March 13, 1930, two years after Portland Publix was opening, the name of the theater was changed to Publix Paramount Theater. The name change was to proclaim all Publix theaters as subsidiary to Paramount pictures. Expectedly, the name change came with a ‘Parade of Entertainment’. The theater put on an all-day event with singers, orchestras, and live acts, while Portland fans packing Broadway Street. Artists such as Crooning King, Ron and Don, Paramount Theater organists - Eddie Magill, megaphonist - the Troubadours, Jobby entertainers and the Rose City Beavers all performed acts throughout the day. The admission was twenty-five cents from opening to 1 pm, thirty-five cents from 1 pm to 6 pm and fifty cents for the evening events. The program was also broadcasting on KOIN radio station from 6:30 to 7:00 pm that evening. To solidify the name change, the theater installed the famous “Paramount” sign that was the largest of this time. The sign was exclaimed to be a “Blaze of Electric Glory”.

Paramount Theater continue to be known for exhibiting Paramount films such as “The Cocoanuts” featuring the famous Four Marx Brothers. This film was a musical comedy the was described to be ‘100 percent [a] talking, singing, and dancing production” which broke all box office records at the Portland Paramount theatre. The Portland press acclaimed it as being one of the year’s outstanding comedy productions. Other musical act seen on stages around the country were made into films through Paramount Pictures. The New York musical “Manhattan Mary” inspired the film “Follow the Leader”, features the story line and one of the original songs from the Broadway show. Famous names in this film include Ed Wynn, Ginger Rogers, Lou Holtz and Stanley Smith.

In 1984, Portland Paramount theater was renovated to be Portland’s new performing arts theater, now known as the Arlene Schnitzer Concert Hall. The 2.5-million-dollar campaign was initiated to cover renovation costs which included (but not limited to), $152,000 for the new skylight glass dome above the lobby, $60,000 in light sculptures, and $250,000 in purchases of theater art. The Paramount Theater is one of the few that have been preserved and enjoy by the Portland performing arts community.",NA,"Butterworth, Beverly H. “Civic Fund-Raising Campaign Pin Their Donors.” The Oregonian, 1 Mar. 1984, p. 89.

M. Heacock, Harris French, Thomas Bruce and Ed Johnson, D. R. Eccles","The Pastime Theater in La Grande Oregon began as a place to show second-run films alongside musical acts. La Fontaine and Dozier, the original proprietors, were known for having films running at all times, no matter how many people were in attendance. The theater began as being known for its comedic showings and eventually developed into a destination for the public to watch first-run feature films, sporting events, live musical acts, Vaudeville, and circus shows.

One of the most notable happenings related to the theater is how many times its ownership changed hands. The Pastime saw new owners six times between April 1908 and November 1908. Along with each ownership change came some sort of alteration in the theater's programming or amenities. Such changes included the installation of an inclined floor, improvements to the exterior lighting, and a larger focus on integrating acts other than films to promote the theater rather than relying solely on newspaper advertisements. More details about The Pastime's ownership changes can be found in the image gallery below.

The public's perception of The Pastime in La Grande was overwhelmingly positive with various newspaper articles naming it as the best theater in town. This was due to not only the exceptional films shown there, but also the wide variety of entertaining shows put on at the venue. A staple of the Pastime was Robert Burton, a singer who routinely shows up as a key aspect of the Pastime's appeal in newspaper articles praising the theater's programming. Apart from one instance of films not arriving at the venue on time, The Pastime was a exceptionally well ran and a high quality, memorable experience for the people of La Grande.

Matlock, The Matlock Family","The property in which the Pastime Theatre resided holds a vigorous past. Initially constructed as a single story building in 1897-1900, the property itself housed four different storefronts. W.F. Matlock was the sole proprietor of the theatre, although his family has ties as well, converting one of the storefronts into the Pastime Theatre in 1900. The Pastime Theatre stood for nearly two decades until it was converted into the Arcade Theatre following a remodel of the property. The Matlock family had owned the entire property by 1921, performing a costly $110,000 remodel to build a second floor and establish what ultimately became the property's crown jewel and most notable theatre to this day, the Rivoli. 

 

The Pastime Theatre was quite the popular nickelodeon, so much so it received daily advertisements in the Daily East Oregonian paper. A large portion of these advertisements didn't typically include the theatre's showings, instead highlighting the theatre's amenities and the next door French restaurant. However others did, proclaiming the Pastime's superiority over the neighboring theatres and the evening's showings. W.F. Matlock understood the need to diversify from similar businesses, and he did so through his proclamation that the Pastime showed more moving pictures than any other theatre in Pendleton at the time. W.F. Matlock's knack for an advertisement was also reflected in his eagerness for promotions, even giving away a gold watch to a lucky theatre-goer. 

 

The theatre itself was fairly small, given it occupied a single unit within a four unit property. Yet it made the ideal location for a Nickelodeon, and W.F. Matlock's continual upkeep created a nice, family friendly environment. 

 ","The property is currently undergoing restoration efforts by the Rivoli Restoration Coalition. They aim to restore the theatre, and were scheduled to finish construction in 2020. However, this date was pushed ahead due to the Covid-19 global pandemic. , The Pastime was renowned for its cut-prices, charging adults $0.10 and children under ten years $0.05 per showing. These prices didn't change for the entirety of the Pastime's existence.","“Historic Rivoli Theater the Northwest's Premiere Showcase Entertainment.” Historic Rivoli Theater, 27 July 2021, https://www.rivoli-theater.com/.

Upon the theater’s inception, he advertised all kinds of pictures, even boasting about “talkies” that would be shown there. The theater was expensive and grand on every scale, with a soaring rotunda, enormous chandeliers, fourteen different curtains and draperies, a Wurlitzer organ, even a mini hotel inside the theater to host traveling vaudeville troupes (1).

            Something that’s interesting about this theater’s promotion when it originally opened was that it had a roughly 10-page special section called ""Poole's Pelican Theatre Edition"" in both the Evening Herald and Klamath News. The content was exactly the same, including the headline at the top of the page. The article congratulated the owner H.W. Poole for finally opening the theater, which had been in the works for some time. Whether or not Poole paid for this, or was just a favor from the papers is unknown.

The theater was advertised as an astounding achievement for Poole. Articles boasted about how high class the theater would be, being a “Class A building.” It advertised itself being the top of the line, with quality heating, equipment, etc.

The last performance at the Pelican was a showcase of barbershop quartets in April 1959. The Pelican theater was razed to make way for a parking lot in 1961.

Penny Arcade,"329 Washington St., Portland, Oregon","Portland, OR",45° 31.13333' N,122° 39.73333' W,1905-01-01,1905,1905-12-31,1905,N/A,"Conducted by William Clackner, Managed by H. Revere","Due to the abundance of Penny Arcades in Portland during the early 20 century, it is difficult to determine which particular location newspapers refer to when they do not mention the specific address and/or reveal the arcade's manager. Looking at articles from 1905, bearing the previous statement mind, it seems as if the Penny Arcade located at 329 Washington Street was conducted by a man called William Clackner and managed by an H. Revere.

An article in the Oregon Daily Journal published on May 24, 1905 mentioned Clackner's Penny Arcade in context of an incident involving a girl's missing coins. It could not be determined whether or not the girl had lost five dollars in the Arcade's phonograph and moving pictures machines even after they had opened every single one. Clackner stated he'd have rather thrown a $5 coin into the street than go through all that ""annoyance."" (1) 

Just five days earlier, the Oregon Daily Journal had published an article about a Penny Arcade (perhaps Clackner's, but it is unknown) that was searched by Police Chief Hunt for graphic imagery. Apparently the arcade had been showing such ""coarse pictures"" in their machines as to ignite Portland's Board of Charities and Correction and the Children's Home of the Ladies' Relief Society, who spoke out about cheap amusement and suggestive content. (2)

      
            The Morning Oregonian published a similarly distressing article two months previous on March 31, 1905. Detective Hawley of Portland named the Penny Arcade as ""a place that should be closed, if the young women of Portland are to be properly looked after. Altogether too many young people frequent it."" (3)

Other research suggests that penny arcades were often places of crime involving children, such as the incident with coarse imagery and an article that mentions the Penny Arcade located at 3rd and Burnside where the manager employed two young girls to encourage men to spend all their money by using their youthful appearance.

Couche, Owner, People's Amusement Company (1911-1919), Owner, Jensen and Van Herberg (1919-1927), Owner, Fox West Coast Theaters (1927-1929)","        One of the earliest theaters in Portland built exclusively for film exhibition (18), the People’s Theater opened at 7 pm on November 1, 1911 (10) as the first theater specifically built by the People’s Amusement Company. The People’s Amusement Company, at the time, was a relatively small, Portland-based firm which owned several other theaters in Portland and Oregon (7). Prior to the opening of the People’s Theater, the firm had little to boast about (excluding of course its ownership of the Oregon state rights to Milano’s Dante’s Inferno) but the new theater would soon change that. The theater, as Motography stated, had the unique distinction of being a largely “made in Oregon” theater with most of the materials and work going into its building coming from Portland and its environs (5)(11).
The People's Theater under construction, courtesy of ""Motography"" (circa. November, 1911)        When built, the People’s Theater contained: a heating and ventilation system; a “new” lighting system; four floors which consisted of a basement that contained a retiring and reception room for the ladies and a restroom and smoking room for the gentlemen, a first floor with the lobby and auditorium, a mezzanine floor on which the central offices of the People’s Amusement Company were located, and a balcony; and, being built out of steel and concrete, was fireproof (1). The theater was remodelled for several thousand dollars in 1915 under the supervision of John F. Cordray. The job was accomplished over a period of six weeks with the majority of the work done after midnight and in the mornings so that the theater could remain open. New improvements included “the retinting and repainting of the whole interior...installation of an improved new lighting system and of a ventilation system...and various changes in seating arrangements and rest rooms for the convenience of the patrons.” Cordray was particularly concerned with the repainting as the violet tint of the decorations had “a tendency to make persons in the audience appear ghastly and old” while the newer warmer colors which replaced the violet made people “look about 20 years younger than before.” In his doing this, the Oregonian hailed Cordray as having “all but discovered the secret of eternal youth.” This renovation also saw the addition of a “depth intensifier” which “accentuates to a surprising degree the lights and colors of a picture, gives it increased depth, brings out its details and adds a stereoscopic effect” (3).
         Ticket prices varied between ten cents for general admission, certain “choice” seats for twenty cents, and the “loge seats” which were reserved for twenty-five cents (5). It appears, however, that later admission prices were raised to twenty cents (21). The People’s Amusement Company, however, would not be the only one to own the People’s Theater as the ownership changed hands several times but most prominently was held by the Jensen and Van Herberg firm (16) and the Fox West Coast Theaters (9). Lasting a good eighteen years before it was remodelled a second time and renamed the Alder Theater (17), this theater located at the corner of the Alder and West Park streets could seat up to 1,400 people and cost 125,000 dollars to build (5).
        While movies did play a larger role in the People’s Theater’s performances, vaudeville, theater, and music acts often accompanied the movies to provide a more well-rounded experience for the sophisticated audience this heater was hoping to attract. The opening night was no exception and featured, among other things, a newsreel of the World Baseball Series, a film called Lost in the Jungle, several vocalists, a photoplay, and a comedic film (12). One of the more entertaining vaudeville acts that made its way through the People’s Theater was Snowball, a “posing horse” (23).
Snowball, courtesy of ""The Sunday Oregonian"" (circa. December 31, 1911) 

      
                     The People’s Theater also held lectures from time to time as the one given by Governor Oswald West in 1912 accompanied by “an educational film” showing his trip to the eastern United States (6)(13). A similar “illustrated lecture” had been given by the Y.M.C.A.’s physical director, Albert M. Grilley, in 1911 and, at the time, Melvin G. Winstock of the People’s Amusement Company announced that he was arranging for there to be a series of similar lectures on “each of the public institutions of the State of Oregon” (2). To top off the memorable experiences one might have at the People’s Theater, the Oregon Statesman reported that a man with a “purple silk bandana” covering his face robbed the ticket booth of about a hundred and fifty dollars in 1927 (22).

        The management of this theater often worked with outside organizations to expose certain groups to the films that the People’s Theater had to offer. For instance, the People’s Theater partnered with the Oregonian to offer children a free viewing of Marguerite Clark in “Snow White.” As the Morning Oregonian reported, special invitations were issued to “the children of the Juvenile Court, the Boys’ and Girls’ Aid Society, Frazer Detention Home, Salvation Army and other institutions as well as the baby homes that permit their children to attend benefit affairs”(15). This was evidently not a one-time event as the theater had a similar Christmastime charity matinee for children five years earlier in 1912 (25). The Moving Picture World, additionally, makes mention of a “Harriman” or “Railroad Day” during which over a thousand employees of the Harriman railway lines in Oregon came to view a film taken of them and also suggests that “all the large department and industrial concerns in this city (Portland) are planning with the management of the People’s Amusement Company to have special evenings for their employees at the People’s Theater at least once a month” (25).
      To attract patrons, advertisements were regularly featured several newspapers including the Sunday Oregonian which often printed stills from the advertised movie in addition (24).
Movie ad, courtesy of ""The Sunday Oregonian"" (circa. January 1, 1922) 
Movie ad, courtesy of ""The Sunday Oregonian"" (circa. July 2, 1916)Children also seemingly were a target demographic for the managers of the People’s Theater who had several contests for school children including an essay competition with the topic being a movie shown at the theater (19) and promising tickets to a box seat for students who have the highest average in their class each month (25). Around the holiday season, Santa Claus frequented the theater and wrote down the wishes of all the children who came (25). Another contest held was a “baby contest” which was held concurrently with the exhibition of the film “Where Are My Children?” and the management offered fifty dollars in prizes (20). In 1912, the People’s Theater held a mock election contest by flashing pictures of presidential candidates and having both men and women in the audience write down their favorite candidate. The results of this “contest” were announced the following Sunday (3). Interestingly, women were allowed to “vote” in this primary which preceded the actual extending of the voting franchise to Oregon women later that year.
      Generally, the People’s Theater skirted controversy especially in regards to censorship, however there were a few instances in which the intended audience of the management was clearly not children. In 1915, the Morning Oregonian reported on a private showing of “the Hypocrites” which prominently featured an actress “cloaked only in art.” Though the film was given the sign of approval from Mayor Albee, it remains unclear whether this film that criticized the hypocrisy of the church in the face of the, very literally, “naked Truth,” passed the Portland Board of Censors though it is known that another private exhibition was given for the “benefit of the Portland newspaper men” (14). On the other hand, in 1924, the film “Forbidden Paradise” was banned from the theater after only one showing and though the management would offer to cut certain moments out, the offer was declined and the film blocked completely (8).","The theater was built and completed in a hundred days., “Super-feature” films started being shown in 1916., Marguerite Clark in “Miss George Washington” sold over 40,000 tickets during Thanksgiving week in 1916.","1.

Pickford Theater,"Park and Washington St., Portland, Oregon","Portland, OR",45° 31.25000' N,122° 40.78333' W,1915-10-30,1915,1916-12-09,1916,"1,000",Louis B. Christ,"The People’s Amusement Company was a well-established and the largest motion picture exhibiting enterprise in Oregon during the early film era. This company was responsible for opening the Pickford Theater on October 30th, 1915, or rather, renaming the former Star Theater located at Park and Washington in Portland, Oregon. The theater was operated by the People’s Amusement Company and was intended to “show Paramount and Equitable service, offering first-run pictures exclusively.” The Pickford theater has a fairly unique name when it comes to the exhibition scene, though it may be clear to fans of the silent era, the title is an attempt to honor the star through showing pictures at this locale.1 Once a number of renovations and improvements were made to the former Star theater, including an increased seating capacity of 1,000, a marble trimmed lobby and a marquis front, the Pickford opened for business.
Advertisements for the Pickford were often informative and attention-grabbing. Frequently in the advertisements they were large and took up much of the page it was on, which likely was an expensive venture at this time. Ads typically were intended on establishing the showtimes for pictures being played at the theater and often included images to go along with the ad or were stills from the film itself. As one may assume, they detailed the length of the film and how long it would be present at the Pickford if it was a limited run film (one included a note that told a film it would only be run for 4 days)2. Also mentioned was the background of a film’s creation as well as the main filmmakers or talent associated with the film, such as director or actor, often this can be seen as another way to draw readers to a theater. This also could be seen as a reflection of the Pickford’s desire to direct attention to the stars of the film, as their name was also an occasion of such an attempt to honor3.

In addition to the many ads seen in the papers around this time in Portland, there were also notes marked with ""special notice"" at the bottom of ad spaces. In these notes, it tells that the theater intends to conduct daily sweepstakes that which a single Portland citizen will be awarded a ""loge party"" for themselves and 7 friends. This party would be hosted by the Pickford and could be attained by simply presenting proof of identification to the box office4. Though it is unclear how a winner is decided, the Pickford seemingly selects a previous or potentially frequent guest of the theater and names them in the paper and then invites them to a showtime later in the week. Promotion such as this was likely a unique and effective way of attaining new guests or maintaining constant business as movie-goers even today can agree, everyone wants to see a movie if it is free.

      
            However, it was not simply entertainment films that were shown at the theater.

One article/advertisement that can be found in the Sunday Oregonian’s issue on March 5, 1916, mentions that a sort of educational film was to be shown by sponsor of the Paige Motor Car Company of Detroit, Michigan. With there being a showroom nearby the Pickford theater, one may find it ironic that the film on display at the theater was to display the fashion in which the cars at Paige were manufactured. In the film, one would have been able to see the complete manufacture of both the Fairfield and Fleetwood models of the Paige Cars. The end-goal of the ad is clear as it mentions the desire one would have to purchase one of these vehicles after seeing the “highest degree of efficiency” at one of the most “up-to-date plants in the United States.” The ad lastly details the film would be a part of the program at the Pickford theater for two days, leading one to draw on this as an idea of the diversity and variety of the bill that would be seen at the theater that is so acclaimed as to have such support from the Paige Motor Car Company5.
Sunday Oregonian, March 5, 1916, p.9sec.6The Pickford theater met it's early ""demise"" as a result of a name contest on Dec 9, 1916. As trivial as it may sound, this came at the response of the Artcraft releases associated with the star and the studios associated with her were being moved to another theater6. The Pickford was planning on offering a cash prize to the winner who selected the new name, though one is never directly mentioned to have won the contest. Further clarified by another article, it confirms the official renaming of the theater back to the original name that many knew it as before it was referred to as the Pickford. According to the article, a total of 3.478 names were suggested by visitors of the theaters owned by the People's Amusement Company7

            Original owner/managers were Max Weiss and Leslie Terwilliger, who opened the Pine Tree to great fanfare in October 1922. Weiss was devoted to the Pine Tree, quitting his previous job to run it. Terwilliger, who ran the Star Theater, also decided to leave his job in order to devote his time operating the Pine Tree. Harry W. Poole purchased the Pine Tree in 1925, four years before he finished construction on the Pelican Theatre. 

The Pine Tree had all the latest hits and boasted about it in the papers. There was an entire article about how it was able to get Hunchback of Notre Dame (1).

The theater had all of the features and comforts of movie palaces built at this time, including a men's smoking area in the upper balcony and a women’s bathroom in which a child could be left with an attendant, creating a stronger draw for women at the time to come to the theater.

New owners took over the theater in July 1950 with yet more grand fanfare and re-christened the theater as the ""new"" Pine Tree, but it didn't last long. The last event notice appeared in the local newspaper in Dec. 1951 for a vaudeville act.

Upham","In October 1912, the grand and luxurious Rex Theatre joined the Folly and the Savoy to mark the beginning of the movie palace era in Eugene, a phenomenon occurring simultaneously across the United States at this time. While earlier movie houses were mostly in storefronts (e.g., the Electric, the Bijou, the Dreamland, and the Bell in Springfield), the new generation of theaters were purpose-built structures designed primarily to showcase movies and maximize the movie-going experience.

The Rex was located at 967 Willamette St. in downtown Eugene right next door to the large Ax Billy Department Store. (The pre-1913 address was 635 Willamette before the street numbering system changed). The Rex had a corporate owner, the Progressive Theater Company, whose principals were C.S. Frank, A.H. McDonald, and F. Upham. McDonald managed the day-to-day operations of the theater.

With 800 seats, the Rex was the largest theater in town, and sporting more onyx trimmings than any other playhouse in Oregon, according to articles in the local newspaper. The seats themselves were designed for maximum comfort, being 21 inches wide instead of the usual 18 inches. The entrance featured decorative glass, magnificent mirrors, and “tasty frescoing,” while the interiors were all “in the best taste.” The Varsity sweets store set up a “branch store” inside the lobby to sell candy and cigars to theater patrons. In the summer months the manager used 2000 pounds of ice daily to keep the theater cool.

The theater’s sign was a massive, gaudy electric crown that hung suspended over Willamette St.

            The Rex presented a program typical of the era, with a combination of one- and two-reel movies, some longer features (5-7 reels), newsreels, comedy shorts, documentaries, and a smattering of vaudeville. A Friday night at the theater in 1912 included four photoplays and a vaudeville act: the two-reel hand-colored feature “In the Land of Lions” (Gaumont), “Sweet Alice Ben Bolt” (Imp), “All on Account of a Song” (Éclair), “Impressing Eliza” (Éclair), and a lyric soprano named Miss Bess Stokes accompanied by Madame Stephanie and Miss Nicklin on harp and violin. Admission was 15¢ for a seat on the main floor, or 25¢ for the balcony.

In 1914, the Rex partnered with the Eugene Daily Guard to run a serialized story with a movie-print tie-in. “Lucille Love, The Girl of Mystery” ran in regular installments in the newspaper, with complementary episodes at the Rex every week. This was a popular marketing strategy across the United States to enhance both newspaper readership and theater attendance.

In late July 1916, the Rex generated some positive local publicity for showing an uncut version of God’s County and the Woman (Vitagraph), a film that had been heavily edited by the Portland motion picture Censor Board when it played in that city (See ""Censors Blast Big 4 Feature"").

At the same time the controversial movie was on the program at the Rex, the Rex manager A.H. McDonald was invited to speak about movie censorship at an interdenominational conference of ministers being held at the University of Oregon. McDonald considered saloons more dangerous than movies. “Censorship is not the way to get good pictures, and is in effect a suppression of freedom,” he argued. The Eugene Daily Guard also ran an editorial against movie censorship in response to the controversy.

While as the Rex was attracting so much attention (and, presumably audience) for “God’s Country and the Woman,” the Eugene Theatre down the street was gearing up for the exclusive Eugene premiere of “Birth of a Nation,” opening on July 31, 1916. It is probably no coincidence that Rex manager McDonald chose to show such a newsworthy film during a week when he would otherwise be sure to lose patrons to D.W. Griffith’s much-anticipated historical epic.

The Rex continued to operate until 1955 when it changed ownership and was renamed the Fox Theatre. The building still stands near the corner of 10th and Willamette next to (or perhaps part of) the Downtown Athletic Club, and while very nice, it is unrecognizable from its earlier glory.

Petrich, Mr. Hadley, Mr. Cooper","The Rex theater, located on A Street West, seemed to be amongst the most popular places of amusement for citizens of Vale Oregon throughout the 1900s and into the early 2000s. Astonishingly enough, the Rex theater stayed in business from 1914 all the way until 2016 when it was shut down. The original owners of the theatre in 1914: Hadley and Cooper, the owners of the Rex theater, were two men who previously owned the Isis Theater; the two men took all of their equipment from their previous location and brought it to the Rex to turn it into a fully functioning theater. The image shown below is an article from Malheur Enterprise which is a weekly newspaper in Vale, Oregon, that has been in business since 1909 (1); the article addresses the opening day of the Rex theater, stated as being ""Malheur County's Largest Playhouse..."", from the previous Monday as well as introducing the manager and owners of the theater. On October 4, 1914, I.B.Quisenberry (manager, who can be seen in a tagged photo below) opened the doors of the theater to host the local high school's play which was said to have filled all 370 chairs of the theater. 
Malheur Enterprise, October 10, 1914, p. 1, Historic Oregon Newspapers.The Rex theater was a theater that hosted several different types of acts. Although the local high school's play debuted the Rex on opening night there were motion pictures, serials and other types of acts that filled up the theater's schedule. On October 17, 1914, only a few weeks after the opening day of the Rex, an advertisement came up in the Malheur Enterprise which entailed the promotion of a serial that would begin showing at the theater soon as well as a peculiar act from 'Madame Viola'. As seen in the article below, a new serial will be coming to the Rex theater and begin playing just a few days after the article posting. ""Lucille Love: A Girl of Mystery"" was a serial directed by Francis Ford and produced by Universal Film Manufacturing Company (2). ""Lucille Love"" is addressed as being a big hit for the folk of Vale, Oregon, which shows why the new serial, ""The Trey O' Hearts"", will be another popular show for the town of Vale at the Rex theater. As noted above, the Rex theater hosted other acts besides motion pictures, serials, plays and dance, as seen in this article, the Rex was the host of 'Madame Viola' who's act includes trained birds and other animals. This article notes that 'Madame Viola' is a returning act to Vale, Oregon, and something that cannot be missed.
Malheur Enterprise, October 17, 1914, p. 8, Oregon Historical Newspapers.In the below article, again from the Malheur Enterprise, it is written that there was an accident that occurred with the Rex theater's projector. The Rex had a Powers Motion Picture Projector; Powers Motion Pictures Projectors were motion picture projectors that were originally manufactured by The Powers Peerless Cameragraph Company of New York in the year 1906. This year matches with the opening of the theater as well as the timing of this accident. The projector had to be taken to Portland in order for it to be fixed, which took only a few days; while the Powers projector was being fixed in Portland, Quisenberry started using an old projector from the theater he managed before the Rex. It seemed that the accident that occurred with the projector was a big enough deal to post on the front page of the local newspaper to let the town's people know that the theater will be up and running again shortly.
Malheur Enterprise, June 12, 1915, p.1, Oregon Historical Newspapers.
      
            The advertisements posted below, taken from the Malheur Enterprise on April 28, 1917 and June 29, 1918, show as an example of the types of ads the Rex would publish in the paper as well as showing the average price for tickets for patrons. The first ad is a weekly schedule for the theater; these weekly schedules were very common for the Rex. In the schedule, it shows that on Thursday and Friday the theater will be showing local films. Local films were very common at the theater as they were commonly shown every week. At the bottom of the weekly schedule, the price of admission is listed for the theater; 5 cents and 15 cents, as listed, was a very common price for the theater when showing motion pictures. However, in the following advertisement for the play, ""The Beast of Berlin"", it shows that the price of admission was 25 cents and 50 cents. This shows that there were different prices of admission at the Rex depending on the type of act they will be hosting. Something special that is noted in the second article is the fact that it is quoted, ""New York stood up and cheered like mad--so will you when you see it...""; this quote shows that the Rex theater had a high enough reputation to get the same acts from a market as big as New York.
Malheur Enterprise, April 28, 1917, p.6, Oregon Historical Newspapers. 
Malheur Enterprise, June 29, 1918, p. 3, Oregon Historical Newspapers.Something noteworthy about the Rex was expressed in the Malheur Enterprise on August 28, 1920. In this article posting, it is noted that the Rex theater will undergo a ""redecoration"" under the new management of Otto J. Petrich. It is stated that when new management took over the theater, they believed the theater was in a run down condition meaning they would add in some new aspects to make the theater first class. In the article it is addressed that the management will be adding a larger picture onto a larger screen as well as adding in new designs and decorations. This article proves that the Rex and its management was proud of their theater and made it a priority to keep up on the building and make it a place where people would be proud to go.
Malheur Enterprise, August 28, 1920, p. 1, Oregon Historic Newspapers.One promotional strategy from 1922 is illustrated in the clipping below. The article doubles as a coupon, and addresses that the Malheur Enterprise and manager of the Rex theater, Otto J. Petrich, came to agreements that this specific advertisement in the paper would work as a 15 cent voucher towards an admission to the theater for the coming Saturday and Sunday's performance. It seems as if this strategy would work very well for the theater, as the Malheur Enterprise is the only newspaper in the town and something that was widely read during these times.

Mendenhall, C.F. Hill, Jack Matlack","The Rialto theater opened on August 30, 1917, owned and managed by A.J. Moran and H.L. Percy (1). The two spent a large sum of money, including $25,000 on building, furniture and fixture costs alone. Moran and Percy were still able to manage a team of over twenty men to construct what they hoped would be a “happily modern theatre.” For its first year, the Rialto found stellar success, but this was interrupted by the Spanish influenza pandemic of 1918, wherein many theatres and places of public meeting were temporarily shut down under the advisement of the surgeon general. The Rialto took this time of forced closure to work on improving the building, including renovations. Once the quarantine (which Percy and Moran supported for public safety, despite short term economic losses) was lifted, the Rialto, as well as the local Page and Liberty theatres, were welcomed back with a record numbers of attendees. (2)

In a full page spread feature of the Rialto theater in Motion Picture News, one of the theater's owners, A.J. Moran, stated that “There is a novel plan used with the changes in program, of which there are four a week. The special emphasis is put on the attraction that is run for three days, Saturday, Sunday and Monday, and generally there is a special lobby display” (3).

      
            During the month of October, the George Hunt Theaters Co. celebrated the anniversary of the company’s incorporation with specialized anniversary programs’. These programs included special events such as the ones advertised for the company’s 9th anniversary: “Good Pictures, Vaudeville and Revues Will Be Offered on Anniversary Month Theater Programs” (4). The company took out a full page spread in the Medford Mail Tribune in order to advertise the specialized anniversary programs that the Rialto and Craterian theaters would be presenting throughout the month of October.

            In the Motion Picture News feature, owner A.J. Moran said “‘We believe in making people talk about our theatre, and we put a lot of faith in the advertising that we get now and then'” (5). The theater placed advertisements in the local paper, Medford Mail Tribune, while also holding special events and promotional stunts in order to get patrons in the door. For example, owner A.J. Moran mentioned in the Motion Picture News feature that “‘Recently we [the Rialto Theatre] showed a Sessue Hayakawa picture and for this occasion we dressed our girl ushers in Geisha costumes and used various Japanese decorations in the lobby and through the entire block. We did not get back as much money as we spent, but we felt that it was well worth while because of the amount of advertising that we got from it.” By putting on these events, the theater was ensuring that citizens knew the theater and, as Mr. Moran stated, “‘We find that it pays to keep our house before the public'.”

The Rialto theater's advertisements were big and flashy from the very beginning of the theater’s opening. Not only did they include photographs or illustrations from the films featured that week, but they often times were quite large on the second page of the Medford Mail Tribune, the local newspaper. The theatre’s logo changed and evolved throughout the growth and development of the theatre. In the beginning, the theater used capitalized block letters for its logo and utilized the style on and off from 1917 to 1924. In an early rendition of the theater’s logo, the words “The Home of the Silent Art” were printed underneath the logo, indicating that this movie palace was the place to go for high quality entertainment. In another iteration of the theater’s logo, an arrow was included across the theater’s name that encapsulated the words “Where Everybody Goes”, therefore showing the prestige and popularity of the theater within Medford. Throughout the theater’s run, it utilized different stylistic embellishments for its advertisements in order for them to really jump off the page. The theater often ran multiple advertisements in the daily paper, several times a week in order to advertise the films currently playing and ‘coming soon’ to the theater in order to tease patrons about what’s coming next to the Rialto.

The Rialto closed in January 1953. (6)

Rivoli Theater,"351 South Main Street Pendleton, Oregon","Pendleton, OR",45° 40.25000' N,118° 47.20000' W,1921-09-10,1921,1958-01-15,1958,810,"Built by: Matlock family (1897-1900), Owned/managed by: Matlock family and Frank Greulich (1921-1958), Owner: The Rivoli Coalition (2010-?), Current Owner: Greg Galloway (2018)","The Rivoli Theater opened on September 10, 1921 in Pendleton, Oregon. However, the building at 351 South Main Street was not always a movie theater. The actual building was built between 1897 and 1900 by the Matlock family for stores opening in the area. Soon, one of these stores was turned into a small theater called “The Pastime,” labeled as a nickelodeon theater. This theater was owned by the Matlock family. A little later on, the entire building became just a theater with the name “The Arcade Theatre.” Two businessmen from the area, Greulich and Matlock, now owned the entire building and re-named the theater “Rivoli” in 1921, ahead of its grand opening. 
Oldest known photo of the Theater around 1927. Photo Courtesy of Rivoli Theatre's Facebok Page.The theater officially opened on September 10, 1921 after a $110,000 reconstruction of the existing building and premiered with the film “The Old Nest” (4). For perspective on just how grand the theater was, the actual stage was 50 feet by 22 feet, held roughly 810 people in the main seating and balcony seating, had five dressing rooms and a jaw-dropping 26-piece orchestra (7). The theater was heavily praised for its architectural style (5), boasted as the best theater west of Omaha (6) and congratulated for giving the people of Pendelton a theater they deserved (8). 

While Rivoli was most well known for showing movies, the theater also hosted a plethora of theater acts. There were many non-movie related shows but a few stand out amongst the many. On October 18 1921, the Ralph Dunbar Opera was hosted at Rivoli (1). On February 24, 1922, Arthur Middelton performed songs for the audience (2). On November 13, 1922, Brooker and Clayton's Georgia Minstrels was hosted by Rivoli (3).

      
            The Rivoli Theater was good at a lot of things but placing advertisements in the local newspaper to attract new audience members might have been something they were amazing at. They advertised mainly big movies including “The Green Temptation” (10), “My Old Kentucky Home” (11) and “The Bachelor Daddy” (12). The theater also put ads in the newspaper for the candy shop that was located inside called “Nifty Nook” (9).

As previously mentioned, the theater hosted the Brooker and Clayton's Georgia Minstrels show in 1922 (3). This show was one of the first and most popular African American blackface minstrel troupes. By today’s standards, this show is obviously very problematic and shines a negative light on the theater for hosting such a show. 

It was not until 1958 that the Matlock family, who were the owners for Rivoli’s entirety, sold the theater. While Rivoli was no more, the building did continue to be a movie theater, named “Centre Theatre,” until the 1980s when it was attempted to be turned into a restaurant diner but later abandoned. Rivoli sat abandoned until 2010 when The Rivoli Coalition, a coalition striving to bring Rivoli back to its former glory, bought the theater. Since then, the theater has been under construction but many delays and pauses have taken place. The new and improved theater was supposed to open in September of 2021 to no avail.

Metzger,"The Rivoli Theatre was established on January 16, 1920 by a man named Gus Metzger.(1) The entertainment house, located centrally in what is now downtown Portland, was in two years' time seating upwards of 1600 citizens. (4) The theater instantly became known for the simple yet eloquent stage design dominated by straight-line aesthetics. (3) The patrons who were fortunate enough to attend the venue were eager to see the renovations from the previous Strand Theatre. The theater was a successful and well-known establishment in the world of motion pictures until it was eventually bought out by Jessie Jones and Archie Holt in 1939 and renamed as Pix. (5)

 
Rivoli Theatre, Portland, Oregon. Date Unknown. Image obtained via Cinema Treasures. The theater gained the widely positive reputation that it did in large part to the diversity of its programming. Throughout its 19-year run, the house was home to a variety of acts and performances including vaudeville, thespian acts, singers, orchestras, comedy and motion pictures. The first motion picture that was shown at the theater was The Golden Trail (1920), an hour-long melodrama set in Alaska. (3) Local advertisements in the Oregon Daily Journal were essential to the exhibition of these various acts, often including pictures of the star performers like Gladys Lucile Bates. (6) Gus Metzger independently operated the theater and had an appreciation for different art forms that were attractive to different crowds in a quickly growing metropolis. There are documented instances where he would plan multiple different shows throughout the course of a day. An excerpt from the aforementioned paper on July 30, 1922 documents daytime orchestral performances followed by evening films intermixed with live singing talent. The combination of different performances set the theater apart from its' competitors. (7)

      
            The theater promoted itself through the outlets that were the most effective for the period with newspaper ads and superficial signs and posters on the building. There was, however, a unique form of marketing that was employed by putting the business on matches. Tobacco usage was extremely prevalent during the 20s and 30s, and matches were essential to consumption. Having the name of the theater on everyday products established psychological conditioning for citizens which made individuals more-readily think of Rivoli when deciding on where to consume forms of entertainment.

The Rivoli was one of the theaters in Portland that allowed African-Americans to come and enjoy films. The front page of The Advocate, an independently published newspaper in Portland that was a voice for black Portlanders during the time period, showcases the theater having a midnight show that featured a sound film using Fox Movietone technology. This was an incredibly exciting night for the African-Americans of Portland because they were able to enjoy this brand new form of filmmaking in all of its wonder in an environment that was safe for them. The night turned out to be a major success for the theatre and marked the beginning of a new era of film history. (8-10)

Hudson","Location of the Rolfe Theatre, 219 W. 1st St. Albany, Oregon, 1925. Digital Sanborn Maps.January 1913: T.G Bligh and George E. Rolfe go into business and lease the property formally rented by the Albany Hardware Co. This theater would be called the Rolfe Theatre before receiving a name change in 1920 to fit its “Egyptian-esque” detailing.

June 1913: The Rolfe Theatre, a new “amusement house” in Albany, opened its doors to the public on June 3. Located at 219 W. 1st St, the theater remained a prominent attraction within the community and continued to operate under this name until 1920. No stranger to the industry, George E. Rolfe spared no expense in an effort to create an attractive venue that would surely connect with the people of Albany, Oregon.

January 1914: There were two theatres in Albany, Oregon, the Globe and the Rolfe Theatre. Both were under the same ownership and often worked together in order to continue their success within their respected community. In an article published by the Albany Daily Democrat, it is mentioned that managers for both the Globe theater and Rolfe Theatre, C.F. Hill and E. L. Hudson, collaborated in order to eliminate the loges within the Globe theater. They will be removed while two rows from are being brought back from the front of the house and placed in their stead. Seats were also temporarily taken from the Rolfe Theatre to fill the front roles at the Globe theater, which were then scheduled to be returned when the new ones ordered arrived. It is also mentioned that the Rolfe Theatre is adding storm doors in an effort to increase the comfort of customers. Other changes include a change to the name. Please refer to the Rameseum Theatre.

            March 1920: Prior to re-branding, the Rolfe Theatre installed a new organ, similar to the one used at the Globe Theatre. The new organ was expected to be ready for use by Friday or Saturday of that week, adding to the already impressive nature of the theatre. The article also notes that both the Rolfe and Globe were declared the cleanest show houses in the state of Oregon by visiting clergymen.
Albany Daily Democrat, Mar. 4, 1920. Newspapers.com.The Rolfe Theatre provided a variety of entertainment, ranging from international acts of comedy to American driven films. To the left is an advertisement for an comedic show titled The Honorable Friend, starring Japanese actor Sessue Hayakawa who is accompanied by Japanese actress Tsuri Aoki. The advertisement to the right is for a film titled The Eagles Wings, described as “A Gripping Photodrama of Love and Adventure, Inspiring Loyalty to the Flag, Home, and Country”. The differences in advertisement techniques is a direct correlation of the entertainment presented, with one advertisement presenting an entertainers name while the other is geared towards the American spirit, done so during World War I.

The contest runs through the end of August, with the only rule being that the recommended name must start with the letter “R”. A strategic promotional ploy, the contest not only generated buzz but provided individuals with an incentive, the opportunity to win a season ticket to both theatres, which is  good from September 1- January 1.The advertisement itself continues to highlight the connection between the Rolfe Theatre and the Globe, both under the same ownership.

Roseway Theater,"7229 NE Sandy Blvd., Portland, Oregon","Portland, OR",45° 32.93333' N,122° 35.31667' W,1924-11-01,1924,2022-06-21,2022,640,H.J. Updegraff,"The theater was originally opened by H.J. Updegraff as an independent and family-owned movie theater. It initially had 640 seats with a main level and a balcony for patrons. This made it one of the city's larger neighborhood movie houses in the 1920s sitting on the corner of 72nd street and Sandy Blvd, where the theater still operates today. 

The Roseway Theater opened in the later months of 1924, and in its opening bill it featured The Signal Tower starring Virginia Valli and Rockliffe Fellowes. It also showed Please, Teacher! featuring Buddy Messinger and Martha Sleeper. Along with the public opening day, the Roseway also help an invitational opening where they played The Fast Worker starring Reginald Denny. All in all, the opening of the Roseway was reviewed as being Universalized and off to a good start by impressing Portland audiences. 
The Roseway Theater in 1952.For a theater to last as long as the Roseway has it has to constantly be changing with the times. In 1926 the theater did just that by installing a 2/5 Smith theater organ according to the Puget Sound Pipeline. The original organ was in the theatre until 1953, when it was removed during the time a Cinemascope screen was being installed. Another organ would be put into the theater in the 1980s. That was a 3/8 Robert Morton. The organs allowed for sound to accompany films, and, specifically in the 1920s, this added life to silent films.
Roseway Theater in 1925 advertising Charlie Chaplin's news movie featuring a pipe organ.Organs weren't the only thing changing throughout the theater's lifetime though. It also saw many managerial changes. In 1927, Updegraff sold the lease on the Roseway to West Coast Theatres. He continued to work there, but the company allowed him more leeway and financial support. In 1929, Updegraff reported a projection room fire that ruined two reels of film and a $800 robbery, but the theater survived to see more owners. On January 2, 1939, Updegraff passed away, and the theater was bought by Jesse E. Jones and was managed by the likes of Jack Beattie, formerly of Medford, and then, in the 1950s, Orville Goodrich was the new manager. He installed wide screen equipment in the theater which was one small portion of the renovations done to the theater during the 50s. After Goodrich was drafted, Al Meyers and Al Fourmet both had their shot at managing too. 

 

      
            The Roseway continued to be successful and stay in business into the early 21st century when, in 2008, it gained a new owner, Greg Wood, and the theater underwent another renovation. During this renovation many of the original art deco touches on the theater were restored. There was also an upgrade to nicer seating allowing patrons to be more comfortable and have more leg room. This upgrade resulted in reduced seating in the theater, the Roseway now seats 330 compared to the original 640. The technology was the biggest upgrade during this renovation. It installed a state-of-the-art digital sound and projection unit, and many claim that the Roseway's sound is unbeatable and even has corporate multiplexes beat. This also allowed the theater to start screening 3D movies, setting it apart from other independent theaters, and truly putting the Roseway into a league of its own.
The interior of the Roseway present day.The Oregonian May 17, 2019. Michael Lloyd.The Roseway got into some hot water in 2019, and the theater and the owner, Greg Wood, were sued by the city of Portland for unpaid taxes. According to The Oregonian the movie house hadn't paid local business taxes for seven years, and they owed the state more than $21,000. There was never much follow-up after the lawsuit was followed but considering the theater is still running and proving to be a success it is assumed that matters were settled.

Today the Roseway continues to show popular films that are shown in mainstream movie theaters, but it also retains its distinctive neighborhood comfort and the intricacies that made it popular over 90 years ago. The original 1920s facade and interior remain intact and as a sight to see for many. With the addition of top tier sound and projection it's no wonder that the Roseway has survived and thrived as long as it has. The Oregon Historical Society puts it best when they say, ""Photographs of the theater from the 1920s to the 1940s adorn lobby walls, testifying to its lasting impact on the surrounding community.""

J.J. (Joseph) Bryan and local businessman E.L. Campbell aggressively promoted the Savoy as “Eugene’s Leading Motion Picture House” and placed regular advertisements in the newspaper to attract audiences.

            The Savoy showed all of the popular features and short films of the time, such as Charlie Chaplin and newsreels. “The Stolen Pie,” a locally made film delighted audiences at the Savoy when it screened in 1915.

The daily program changed up to four times a week. Admission was set at the competitive price of 10¢ through 1916. 

One of the Savoy's unique programming strategies was to offer election returns in the theater. In an era before radio or television, one could spend an entertaining evening at the theater with periodic updates on local and national election returns delivered via Western Union Telegraph.

Both of these theaters were in downtown Medford and near the train station which during its time, could have attracted a lot of people to attend.

Hall","    Savoy Theater was a big part of Central Point, mostly due to the entertainment that it provided as well as acting as a communal space for the local high school and church groups. It's mentioned in a local newspaper that it would be host to group members of the Methodist church and had a separate advertisement for the high schools Glee club that would be performing. But besides being a community gathering location, it would still function as a theater that provided entertainment. It had everything from comedy shows, to the best and newest plays such as the six act showing of, ""Graustark"". One particular way that they would provide promotion was to introduce weekly programs to allow town members to see what's playing and when, which can be seen below. The most popular days would be the weekends along with Tuesdays and Thursdays. To gain some interest and get the attention of an audience, one promotional strategy that this theater utilized was having a free matinee, to which would surely catch the eye of any newspaper reader.

Savoy Theatre was also in a very busy part of town, as it was near a lot of the major businesses, available to see with the included image of its location above. Because Central Point was not as known, Savoy Theater was among the many theaters in Oregon to be rediscovered. Most likely at the center of amusement for those in residence at Central Point. Since a lot of the advertisements for Savoy Theatre included many promotion strategies such as free matinees, the theater was most likely aiming at families who wanted to enjoy movie-going experiences without the stress of paying for entire families. Those who also enjoyed a new form of entertainment and in a range of various plays were assumably a part of the audience as well.",NA,"Central Point Herald. “Free Matinee June 25 at Savoy Theater.” Historic Oregon Newspapers, 24 June 1915, p. 4.

That same year, in May, the Isis was renamed “Sherry’s”, while retaining its manager, B.M. Sherwood. In 1927 it was purchased and re-named the Colonial.

Built for opera, vaudeville, and theatrical performances, the theatre was composed for large scale premiers. There are loge seats (box seats) for the elite customers willing to pay 20 cents rather than 10 cents for typical admission.

The film received wild reviews afterwards as well as intervals of claps throughout the picture. It showed Friday, March 1924 at Sherry’s Theatre.

The Virginian (1923): This is a wild one. Not only did it receive great reviews in theatres, the stories about what happened during production are rather exciting: Kenneth Harlan (actor), accidentally shot himself in the leg during a duel scene. Florence Vidor as “Molly Wood” fell off her stage coach after a horse had an accident. Once the news got out of the hectic filming of the film, it was a must watch for moviegoers in La Grande.

The building was constructed in 1901, and in 1909 was converted to Athena’s first theatre house after the closing of a saloon there. It started as the Dime Theatre, then named the Dreamland in 1911, next the Peoples in 1916, and finally in 1919 became the Standard. When first opened in 1909 the theatre still had a flat floor, a skylight letting in disrupting light, and no stage. The theatre went under a lot of renovations in 1919 to be opened as the Standard, the floor was given a slope, a stage was created, the skylight was removed, and new seats were added courtesy of the Cosy theatre in Pendleton (1). The Standard had its first showing to the public on a Wednesday evening on June 4th, 1919. The opening program featured Henry Walthall in “A Still Small Voice” and Charlie Chaplin in “The Rink” to bring on laughter for audiences (2).

The Standard Theatre programs seemingly all were silent films, and admission prices were usually 10 cents for kiddies, 25 for kids, and 35 for adults, and also could include a war tax (3). The theatre made a lot of appearances in the towns newspaper The Athena Press, on the front page of the paper there were often articles talking about what programs were going to be shown at the theatre or any other news. The advertisements gained a consistent format, it would be one long rectangle outlined with a think black border and would name the programs on the normal Saturday, Sunday, and Wednesday showings and give a brief description of the films. Comedy was a common selling point to encourage audiences to come have a laugh. 

      
            The Standard Theatre was also used for other events in the community aside from just showing films. Various different groups used the theatre venue for meetings, music performances, and more.  Among the music events at the theatre, the University of Oregon's orchestra played successful concerts there (4). Even the candidate Walter Pierce running for governor in 1922 used the Standard to address the voters of Athena (5). 

In some places other ventures may pose as competition to local theatres, but in Athena the Standard Theatre seemed to be a vital part of the community. The only time there seemed to be an impact was during the Pendleton Round-Up, the theatre claimed they would not be having showings the night of the rodeo which a big event like that would likely draw large crowds from all around (6). The theatre held multiple benefit showings, one being to raise money for constructing the towns first swimming pool (7), and another time there was a benefit held for the high school athletics with a special program put on by students before the movie showing (8).

The Standard Theatre closed indefinitely in mid January in 1930. Turns out competition could pose a threat to the theatre, but not from other ventures in the town, but instead cinema itself. The emergence of sound pictures and dialogue gained popularity among moviegoers. The Standard was unable to keep up revenues with only showing silent films so ultimately had no choice but to close its doors (9).",NA,"(1) “History of the Gem Theatre.” Gem Theatre. http://gemtheatre.org/index.php/about-us/history-of-the-gem-theatre

Ford","Notably, Henrietta B. Leiter (frequently referred to as ""Mrs. O.C. Leiter"" or ""Mrs. H.B. Leiter"") owned both the Star theater and Arcade theater in La Grande, both of which were purchased by J. Donald Meyers and Ed Ford. She was involved early in the La Grande film exhibition business, recognizing that the city’s important location among the state’s rail system would position it as an important site of exhibition.

Theater managers Meyers and Ford frequently wrote brief statements about pictures they screened at the Star theater. These 2-3 sentence reviews were published in Exhibitors Herald, and provide a useful source for information about the type of pictures commonly shown at the Star Theater. 

In 1922, the Star Theater showed the following pictures:

The Conflict (1921)
	I Do (1921)
	The Silent Call (1921)
	The Sign on the Door (1921)
	Woman’s Man (1920)

            It is specifically worth noting that these motion pictures are all different than those that were screened at the Arcade theater, another La Grande theater managed by Meyers and Ford. It is possible that the managers took advantage of their multiple theaters to screen a wider variety of films, and potentially reach an overall wider audience by doing so.

Mr. Ford also engaged in creative promotional strategies, such as dressing up as a ""Turk"" and employing a ""properly attired 'harem'"" and driving around La Grande for a week prior to showing the film The Virgin of Stamboul (1920).

In 1917, Moving Picture Weekly reported that Mrs. O.C. Leiter–the original owner of both the Star and the Arcade–had purposely positioned the Arcade theater as an “all-feature” house, while the Star’s programming wasn’t necessarily intended to reach widespread audiences to the same degree.

In 1923, a fire in the adjacent store caused significant damage to the walls of the theater. The Star theater was condemned, and closed for repairs. It continued to operate as a silent movie theater through the fall of 1929 when it was closed and re-opened in November as the Granada theater.

Houston owned the Star Theater as well as Temple Theater and Houston's Opera House in Klamath Falls. They were all closely located near each other all on Main Street. Klamath Falls being a small town, this isn’t much of a surprise to me because smaller population usually results in only a few people running the town and owning multiple businesses. J.V. Houston even eventually was elected to city council in 1912 when he opened up Temple and Star in 1912.

According to the above article from the Evening Herald in May 1916, J.V. Houston was finally making Star a “real theater.” Originally, the Star was used as a musical theater primarily with performances of the Star Theater Orchestra and other traveling musicians. Then J.V. began incorporating motion pictures into the program.

I don’t think this necessarily means that the theater wasn’t “real” but rather he is making it feel more real. Thus, the new improvements such as the Powers machine and the fixing of the sloped floor. Also, the introduction of more film screenings allowed for the “real” feel a theater should encompass. Now, Star Theater was more than primarily a performance hall for music and dances but had much more focus on the motion picture aspect.

            Moving pictures were obviously a common feature at Star theater and the newspapers often advertised weekly showings for Star. Some articles were just brief mentions of the upcoming film showings, but there were longer articles as well (for perhaps the more notable pictures).

            One of the most interesting articles I found was the featuring of “The Williamsburg Submarine Pictures”. In the ad, this reel was recognized as “The World’s Greatest Motion Picture in Seven Great Reels”. The emphasis on this must have been important to the owners and managers of Star Theater because of the incredible way the film was made (according to the article).

            Often movies with famous actors like Mary Pickford, Lillian Walker and Anita Stewart were shown. This may be to increase viewership and draw more people into the theater. Also, the mentioning of Vitagraph stars (which were perhaps the most popular stars in Hollywood in the early 1900s) added to the allure.

            The genres of the motion pictures presented at Star Theater include comedies, action films, dramas and more. This allows the audience to have many options to choose from when going to see a picture. Thus, making the target audience larger and attracting more Klamath Falls citizens to the theaters.

            Additionally, the musical performances were widely advertised. It seems as if motion pictures and music had an equal relationship in performing at Star Theater in the 1910s.

Star Theater had many promotional strategies in the form of newspaper tie-ins and collaborations with other local businesses. This was extremely popular for motion picture theaters in the early 1900s because it gave people a reason to come in and watch the film (as they got rewarded for it in free and discounted items). This probably came in handy for the working class audience.

Even theaters back in the 1900s knew that mistakes would be made and they didn’t shy away from it or try to cover it up. I found an article warning the public of Star theater's shipping mistake. This was incredibly responsible because they owned up to it, which gave the theater credibility. The audience could trust them and hope mistakes as such wouldn’t be made again.

Racism was a common occurrence in Oregon in the early 1900s. “Blackface” and calling African-Americans names were presently found in newspapers to advertise films.

Opening Day: 

On the opening day of The Star, the building was not yet completed but was able to accommodate guests for the evening1. The Theater presented a five-act Vaudeville which included juggling, a musical sketch, a rag-time pianist and dancer, and pictured melodies1. The theater was confident that it would be profitable even with tough competition in the area1. They accomplished this by previewing performances in Portland first and only sending the best ones to The Star1.

The First Couple Years:

The Star proved to be a success with reports of many full crowds5 and the presence of multiple popular acts being shown in the small town. The theater advertised an Edison projector that showed popular life motion pictures1. The theater also premiered popular plays such as The Lighthouse by the Sea2. The Star offered five acts per program5 and changed the program weekly on Mondays and had a change of acts on Thursdays3. The theater was also the only Vaudeville house to offer a children's matinee on Sundays costing only 5 cents4. The theater ranged in prices starting at 10 cents in 19043 to 25 cents for general admission in 19062. 

 

      
            Owners, Controversy and the End:

The Star theater had a handful of people in charge of the theater during its time. The theater was first built by S. Morton Cohen as described above and managed by P. Gevurtz which appears to be in their control until around 1910 when the theater was bought by the Portland Amusement Co.6 and managed by Donald Preston7. Around this time the theater was involved in a lawsuit between the Crystal Theater, another Astoria theater, and the Motion Picture Patent Co6. In this case, Henry Newman, owner of The Crystal, sued the Motion Picture Patent Co. because The Star theater was getting the first pick of new, better movies coming to town and The Crystal was getting the second pick despite both theaters paying a weekly licensing fee6. The next change of hands occurred around 1918 when S. Danz was mentioned associated with the theater in a magazine8. Between 1918 and 1922 the theater was bought by the Astoria Amusement Co.who owned many other theaters in Astoria and was managed by John Hamrick9. Unfortunately on December 8th, 1922, the theater burnt down in a devastating fire that destroyed a large portion of downtown Astoria along with many other theaters9.

Turner , Marine Investment Co, Props, People's Amusement Co, Props, S. Morton Cohn","The Star Theater is a moving picture theater located in downtown Portland, Oregon, at 361 Washington at the NW corner of Park. It was open from 1904 to 1920. In 1904 it opened as a vaudeville house and was said to be the “best equipped vaudeville house in the west” (1). The ad for opening night included acts “to laugh at,” “to please the eye,” “that entertain,” and “that amuse,” (2) and it included fun geometric shapes, I assume to bring reader’s eyes to their ads. After it opened it seemed to stay a vaudeville house until sometime between 1909 and 1910. During this period of time it seems that they made the shift from vaudeville to motion pictures. In 1913 it was renovated and was described as “The New Star.” It was said that “The New Star” was “superbly ventilated” and had upholstered seats for “extreme class.” This renovation was supposed to create “The New Star habit” (5), meaning people would start habitually attending the Star. They used what seems like a remodeling as a way to get people to come visit the Star Theater.

            Example of Star Border. Morning Oregonian, Mar. 17, 1915, p. 2. Historic Oregon Newspapers.The Star Theater didn’t have a particular type of film that they liked to show but they did seem to show what was popular at the time. One promotional strategy that the Star Theater used was to create a star filled border (7) around its ads in order to separate it from the rest of the page in hopes people see that ad first. The ads also made a point to mention who was starring in the film as a way to get people to come see their favorite actors. For example, when the Star was showing “The Witch Girl” they made it a point to mention that Mary Fuller was in it and adding “the Ever-Popular Star” underneath her name that was written just as large as the title of the film (6). The ads also oftentimes had large photos of the film or people in the film on it (8). This made the ads more visually appealing and eye catching. They also held some contests to gain more attention from potential viewers. One contest that caught my eye was the contest they held for babies (3). They picked three babies and it seems as though they used these babies in a film and those films were given to the parents as souvenirs. This baby contest seemed to be used as a way for parents to bring their babies to the theater and get them in the door. Once they saw the theater they would be more likely to come back. In 1922, there was an announcement made that the Star would be torn down and a new building would be put up in its place (9).",NA,"Sunday Oregonian, June 12th, 1904, Page 18

Star Theater,379 State Street,"Salem, OR",44° 56.41667' N,123° 2.35000' W,1908-09-14,1908,1914-12-31,1914,Unknown,"Fred Bligh, T.G. Bligh, W. A. Aryes","The Star Theater of Salem Oregon was opened initially as a high-class theater, often performing longer films as well as a variety of live performances, before later moving its business strategy towards becoming a nickelodeon theater, performing more shows weekly to keep audiences entertained. The Star Theater was primarily managed by Frank Bligh, a beloved owner who always kept the theater relevant with exciting entertainment, and wholesome promotions like bringing in a “tiny horse” for families to pet and see on exhibition in the theater. The theater was successful during its early years of operation, with only minor setbacks such as a small fire that occurred in the film room once, leading to a memorable story of manager Bligh entertaining the guests and keeping the peace while the fire was dealt with. The theater during the early years of operation, the theater focused on the more prominent names, new productions as well as big name in-person performers such as Ed Berg, a singing comedian who was a known actor throughout the vaudeville circuit, having several successful tours completed before he began his residency at the theater in its opening year. The Star Theater slowly began to transition to a more accessible and available nickelodeon into the 1910s due to economic instability, and financial hard times. The theater tried to stay open until 1914 when it closed temporarily, being bought by a man by the name of W. A. Ayres in early 1915, however, after the purchase of the theater and its renovations that followed, there is little to no mention of the theater in any Salem-based newspaper, presumably closing the same year. The only available source of information about the theater after the initial closing was an article discussing the building's use as a polling station in 1916.

      
                            The primary locations I used to research the Star Theater and where the most information regarding the theater can be found in three newspapers based in Salem, the Capital Journal, the Statesman Journal, and the Daily Capital. The Daily Capital was primarily useful in finding advertisements concerning the Star Theater, with the primary references to the theater being the shows performed in the theater. The next main source I used was the Capital Journal. The Capital Journal primarily had various stories, talking about the attractions and various special events that Frank Bligh would occasionally hold. Finally, The Stateman Journal had most of the data on the theater’s operation and the different effects on the theater whether it is the economic hardships leading to its change to being a nickelodeon or its various occasional openings and closings. All these papers were available through Newpapers.com. However, finding data such as Sanborn maps of the area during its years of operation is impossible as the data doesn’t exist so instead, the closest available map was used. Finding digital media of the theater was also difficult, with the search for any digital media of the theater or information on the structure of the theater, with the seat count and design of the theater remaining unknown.

               

                During my research of the Star theater, I had to employ a variety of strategies to find and document the history of the theater. The primary search method I used was to begin by casting a wide net for any type of information I was looking for, for example when looking for the opening of the theater, I began with the most general and broad search of any matches of the words Star, Theater and Open. After viewing the general trend of information from significant sources, I would then tailor my search to match more of the wording or repeating patterns related to the theater, such as “Star Theater” as well as “Frank Bligh” and “Open” and refined my search to 1906-1908,  two years leading up to the first known reference to the theater, which led me to documents describing the illustrious theater becoming a mainstay in the Salem community following its opening. Other techniques I used were to search for specific quotes that would apply to certain scenarios, such as “Old Star theater” when looking for any reference to the theater’s life after its initial closing, but only finding minimal references at all about the theater use after refurbishment.",NA,NA

Hoffman , Harry Wyse, H.W. Bassett & J.A. Walkup","July 5th, 1911 marked the opening of the Star Theatre with a simple announcement declaring a ""New Moving Picture House"" in The Bend Bulletin 1. The Star was opened by Edd Newman and Al Hill, two entrepreneurs out of Edmond, Washington, trying to make it in the movie exhibition business. Admission prices were 15 and 10 cents. In the theater's first few months of business  boasted of an electric piano, an ""electric sign to blaze forth on the street,"" 2, big crowds, films with big stars, programs that show four times a week and shows given every night. The early success meant that Newman, who bought his partner Hill's shares in the venture early on, could invest in an aluminum screen which lessened the flicker of the projector3. A year after the initial opening, Newman sold the Star to new proprietors. This first change in ownership was the first in a number of management changes that ocurred in the next year, ultimately resulting in a fizzled out ending of the Star.

            The Star proclaimed to show only the best pictures for family audiences that were approved by the state board of censorship1. The Star showed all kinds of films from all kinds of genre, and  number of well-known films including, “A Tale of Two Cities,"" “The Three Musketeers,” “The Shelling of San Marcos” and “The Coming of Colombus."" However, other things were shown as well including Vaudeville, State election results, current events, ""Oregon scenes"", Biblical films, Portland newsreels and instruction films about electricity5. This type of diversity and high quality films were just a few tactics the Star management used to make their establishment to meet their advertising goal to ""please all""6. 

 

More than just moving images, the Star Theatre was a town hub for the community. The theater space was rented out and used a community center for local events, discussions, benefits, and meetings. Most commonly, the Star was used by local churches for Sunday services. In fact, Presbyterian preacher Dr. Gorby, whose church used the Star throughout 1912, was also involved with theater events. One of the theater's largest advertisements was a competition to vote for the ""Most Popular Girl in Bend,""4.  For six weeks, theater patrons could place their vote for the most popular girl in town with the winner would win a ""$75 Dollar Talking Machine""4. The weekly votes were counted by Dr. Gorby. In addition to church events, other community events were hosted by the Star included Library Benefits, Boy Scout events, High School benefits and dances, Ladies clubs and companies like the Arnold Irrigation company and General Electric. Beyond what we think of as the role of movie theaters today, it's clear that The Star was much more than that. The Star Theatre was much more than that to Bend.",NA,"1. The Bend Bulletin.

This particular newspaper was only published once a week, and in the weeks from September 26th to October 17th 4 out of the 5 published papers had advertisements and or information on the theatre. On the October 17th issue of the paper, there is a short news piece that says the theatre will no longer be showing moving pictures, which is when this theatre is presumed to be closed. These short lived theaters were a common occurrence at the time, as moving pictures were seen by many as a good investment, and way to make money, however due to the number of and the content of the advertisements, it seems that this particular theatre only lasted a few weeks. ",NA,NA

Sigsbee, Elaine George","Heppner, Oregon, was home to its very own Star Theatre, which was known as being one of the only theaters to show moving pictures in Heppner during the early 1920's as well as being a popular public space for other forms of performance art, including popular vaudeville productions. Heppner's Star Theatre was first owned and operated by R.E. Redifer until in 1916 when he sold it to J.B. Sparks. (6) The programs at the theatre usually showed local short films and/or feature length films. The first newspaper article referring to the Star Theatre in Heppner is in May of 1912, when the Senior Graduation Class of Heppner High School held a production of the high class comedy titled ""Mr. Bob."" This night is special because it is the first noted showing at the Star Theatre in Heppner, but also because of the theatre's support of local community productions. The price for reserved admission was listed at the bottom of the advertisement at 50 cents per seat. (3) 

In 1919, the Star in Heppner closed down under the sole ownership J.B. Sparks, because of the Spanish Flu. Because of this, Sparks traveled to Portland to purchase photoplays to presumably use in his own theater. As of 1920, B.G. Sigsbee was the sole owner of the Star Theatre. (7) The films typically screened at the theatre ranged in genres, including comedies, drama, war, etc. Some of the titles that were showcased during the summer of 1920 include the female-leading comedies: ""The Tiger Girl"" featuring Lillian Gish, a D.W. Griffith Production, ""Cupid Forecloses"" featuring Bessie Love, ""How Could You Jean"" featuring Mary Pickford, and ""A Woman of Pleasure"" featuring Blanche Sweet. (2) 

The Star Theatre was a popular public space in Heppner during its run, however there were many other cultural activities and entertainment options for spectators searching for them in Heppner in the early decades of the 1900's. Heppner celebrated Armistice Day for years and in 1928, an ad disclosed a variety of entertainment options available to the paying public, both outdoors and indoors. (1) These other events included a big parade located at Heppner Rodeo Field, followed by the highly-anticipated auto races which were regarded as the ""biggest fun making even in the history of Heppner"" with a mention of prizes for the winners. Football games were also widely popular among Heppner citizens and the game Heppner vs. Hermiston was promoted in the newspaper right next to the former activity options. A super special program and picture show at the Star Theatre, starting at 7:30 pm, titled ""Dress Parade"" and starring W.M. Boyd lists prices varying from 25 to 50 cents. This picture is regarded as ""one of the best war comedies ever produced."" The promotional strategies used by the authors of the included advertisements in the Heppner Herald or The Gazette Times included good word of mouth, sensationalist or exaggerative sentences and article headers were often utilized to catch readers' attention and persuade spectators to attend such events, these business strategies often worked as entertainment forms like moving pictures gained in popularity and widespread affection. 

      
            In 1929, the Star Theatre was remodeled and as of 1947, the Star was owned and operated by Elaine George, who inherited the theater from her mother. One of the prominent female theater owners in Oregon at the time, Elaine George who was known for controlling vandalism and pranks in her town by local youngsters by putting on such a good program at the Star Theatre that the next morning, the streets were noticeably clean and free from disruption. (9) Elaine was popular in Heppner through her family's historical significance in the community and because of her ability to bring together all ages of the population in attendance at her movie theater. In 1954, she hosted a show for GI's from Texas who were formally trained in Fort Bliss, Texas. The GI's were hosted as her guests of honor with a screening of a military genre film titled ""Take The High Ground."" (10)



The films screened at the Star Theatre were censored by Elaine herself, even giving her personal opinions about the pictures and the reasons to see them. In a news article from August 1947, the following reasoning was quoted as being used by Elaine when certain pictures were too mature for immature audiences writing that the screening ""was confined to adult suitability."" (11) Elaine's theater program had a homespun atmosphere, as she would speak to the crowds herself and upheld a chatty and interesting mood. She was known for writing personal letters at the Star to prominent social figures in Heppner including school educators, authorities, music clubs and musicians. Elaine also screened home-made features at the Star Theater, and in August of 1947 she screened a picture photographed by her own father twenty years prior. The feature was noted for including ""all of the inhabitants"" and ""everything that makes a good picture."" (11)

Roy of San Francisco came to Medford in the summer of 1928 and leased part of the Montgomery Ward building for his new State theater, at a reported cost of $20,000 (1).  An article in the local Medford Daily News indicated that the theater would have 400 seats ""modern type of upholstered chairs"" to ensure the comfort of audience members (2). 

Mr. Roy was especially proud of installing a ""Moviephone"" system for providing synchronized musical accompaniment to silent movies. According to an article in the Medford Mail-Tribune, ""Installation of ""Moviephone"" equipment will give a musical interpretation for each phase of the screen action. This device is synchronized with the film and has a pleasing tonal quality, said to be superior to most machines of the kind. The ""Moviephone"" has proved a sensation in California, where several have been put in operation. The new Medford theater will have the first machine of the kind installed in Oregon (3).

The State theater featured two-hour programs that were provided regularly throughout the week and included six changes weekly, with “a Wednesday feature film being held over for the second day’s showing on Thursday” so that Thursdays were the only days in which no new programs were offered. The shows presented by the theater ran from 1 o’clock in the afternoon until 11 o’clock at night. Admission for adults was 15 cents while children, under the age of twelve years old, were allowed in for 10 cents (4).

Compared to the Rialto and Craterian theaters under the management of George A. Hunt, the promotion for the State theater seems quite small and measly. While those theaters under the management of George A. Hunt are flashy and published on multiple pages in the daily paper, the promotion for the State theater is often times overlooked because they are so small. Some of the advertisements seem almost like postage stamps in the corner of Medford Mail Tribune, the local newspaper. The State theater keeps its promotional advertisements sweet, simple, and uniform by only utilizing the theater’s name and location (“South Central Near Eighth”) as a commonality throughout its advertisements. The theater rarely, if ever, uses illustrations or photographs for their advertisements and usually just list the feature films in the program for each night. The theater seemed to struggle throughout its four-year run due to the fact that the theater advertised sporadically and often taking up very little advertisement space within the newspaper page.

The State closed in 1932 to make way for the Studio theater.

One of the renovations that came in 1919 was a ramp “to eliminate stair climbing for those to whom it is objectionable.” The theater branded itself in an advertisement in the Sunday Oregonian for the grand opening as a “continuous ‘Photoville.” This meant that programming entertainment would include a combination of beloved vaudeville acts as well as the latest moving pictures.

            The Strand Theater heavily used advertisements in local newspapers. An ad from the Morning Oregonian has a logo stating the seats are 10 cents at any time. This same ad also states “You’ll Know Why This Theater Jumped Through the Golden Hoop Called ‘Success” and also tells the readers about the programming. This advertisement is able to attract the community by telling them the price, the program, and also gives them a pitch on why the theater is so successful. The programming in this ad has 4 different vaudeville acts including a “violin virtuoso”, an “aerobatic skit”, as well as blackface comedians. This same program also showed “The Great Problem” featuring Miss. Violet Mersereau. The programming at the Strand Theater changed the entire program every Thursday and Sunday.

Houston (who owned Houston Opera House) also owned Temple Theatre. He allowed more freedom in the films he showed at the Temple and could really use this theater as means of motion picture entertainment rather than THE cultural hub of the city (Houston Opera House). I like to think of this as one of Houston’s side projects.
Temple Theatre, Main Street, Klamath Falls, date unknown. Image courtesy of Klamath County Museum.Temple Theatre was meant for motion pictures primarily. While John V. Houston’s Opera House attracted vaudeville acts, balls, sporting events, you name it… his Temple Theatre was the place to go to catch the latest flick. There are various brief advertisements from the 1910s and 1920s saying what film was going to be shown at the Temple that week.

Often times, these brief Temple Theatre presentation announcements would announce the genre of motion picture the film was as well as the length. This gave all plenty of information to the reader to see if they wanted to catch one of those films that week (1).

      
            War movies, comedies, and dramas were among the most  popular genre shown at Temple Theatre. The movies that were featured here seems to be reaching to a young adult target audience for the working and middle class, rather than family-friendly. J.V’s first theater was where a family could get together to enjoy their family-fun but Temple was more directed at a mature audience (especially with the popularity of war films).

It seems that Saturday was a popular movie-going day. Perhaps because this was the only day the working class got time off. Thus, giving into my assumption that Temple Theatre heavily attracted a working class, adult audience.

J.V. Houston used the Temple Theatre as a way to make changes occur in the neighborhood. He often gave away free movie tickets if Klamath Falls citizens did good for their community. This includes things like cleaning up dirty streets in town (2). This was a promotional strategy that J.V. did often throughout the years (evidence of it starting in 1914 and going past 1917).

It seems that although the films shown were primarily mature and for adult audiences, the Temple Theatre made sure that it reached out to kids. I have found evidence of “ice cream showings” and other kid-friendly and kid-oriented events (but most of them on Friday) (3).

The Temple Theatre often bragged about their use of new technology. Such as Edison inventions and new motion picture machines (4).

It is not to be ignored that J.V. Houston and his wife had a great connection to the children of Klamath Falls. They often gave away free tickets and ice cream to “kiddos,” especially ones that couldn’t afford it (5). Their generosity did not go unnoticed.

His kindness didn’t extend to only children, but also workers who kept the city maintained, like firefighters (6).",NA,"Temple Theatre advertisement, Evening Herald, Nov. 7, 1916, p. 4. Newspapers.com.

Cooper","The Temple Theatre in Pendleton, OR had its grand opening show on September 27th, 1915 where it showed 4 part feature ""Her Shattered Idol"". The theatre is thought to be located on the corner of what at the time was Main st. and E. Webb st. in a room of the Temple building which also served as a hotel. Although its exact address was unable to be found explicitly stated, other newspaper advertisements provided their address and relative location to the Temple Theatre.

The theatre was owned by manager Jas B. Welch, and later in February of 1917 new manager E. L. Cooper took ownership of half of the theater and word was Welch was to retire. The exact reasoning and closure date of the theatre is currently unknown, but it is assumed to be around April 14th, 1917 as it was one of the last showings of one of their hippodrome vaudeville acts, and days later a newspaper clipping advertised the grand opening of the Arcade Theatre named as the former Temple Theatre on the 22nd. 

      
            The Temple Theatre held a wide variety of events. Vaudeville shows were very common, and later claimed superior programs of hippodrome vaudeville acts. They also showed multiple real feature films, a popular photoplay show, and many other types of shows. There were events unrelated to cinema as well, they often held community style shows displaying and modeling women and mens clothing, and concert recitals and other music acts like the Native Hawaiian touring band. There was even a christian science lecture held by a church. 

As an interesting fact there was one scandal found, the Temple Theatre along with dentists offices that were also located in the same Temple building, had been robbed by thieves. Manger Welch claimed that he knew at least $94 dollars in cash was in the office that had been taken, and gold was taken from the dentists. ",NA,"Historic Oregon Newspapers.

The theater seated 750 people and was built by Frank Hyde, a local architect in the area, while B.F. Shearer Inc. of Seattle was in charge of the equipment, decoration, and lighting of the movie house(1). The theater was scheduled to open on August 15, but because of delays the opening of the theater was held officially on the 25th of September. A few years later in 1927, L.E. Partridge purchased the interest of his partner Morrison (2), and continued to run the theater by himself until 1934.
Moving Picture World, 12 May 1923. p. 187-188. Media History Digital Library.The Coliseum had a unique run as a movie house and held many exclusive events throughout its time as a popular theater in Tillamook. For example, in 1924 The Coliseum held a special program sponsored by the Kiwanis Club, during which the film Boy O’ Mine played on the night of May 14. The Kiwanis Club advertised that Anthony Euwer (humorist and Portland author) would also make an appearance and that there would be local entertainment in addition to the movie (3). The Coliseum also held meetings and conventions for groups like The Elks, who held their own meetings at the theater(4). The American Legion also arranged for a film to be played at the theater in observance of Armistice Day, which marked the armistice signed between the Allies of World War I and Germany at Compiègne, France on November 11, 1911. After the film was shown a dinner was put on by the Legion Auxiliary for veterans of war (5).

      
            While the theater had many successes during its time as a successful movie house, there were also a few obstacles that The Tillamook Coliseum had to overcome. On July 4, 1924, it was reported that a fire broke out around 8pm in the basement of the building next to The Coliseum. The fire was only noticed because owner Morrison was headed into the basement when the fire started, and he immediately notified the fire department about the disaster. The theater was filled to capacity with all of the holiday visitors for the 4th of July, and panic began to fill the theater as the audience saw smoke coming from below the stage. Mr. Morrison quickly mounted the stage and told the audience that “a blaze had started in an adjoining building, that there was no immediate danger, and warned the audience to leave without disorder.” At that same time the organist, Merle Harrington, struck up a lively tune and continued to play while the audience left the theater until it was completely empty.
Image Courtesy of Cinema TreasuresThe blaze was believed to have started in a pile of rubbish that was sparked in the basement of the building next door. The firemen came as quickly as they could, but the blaze had already burned through to the second floor and extensive damage had been done . So extensive was the damage that the property loss of the theater was estimated at $35,000. Despite the extensive damage, however, The Coliseum was able to bounce back from the flames and continued to play films and hold special events for the community once the damage was repaired. After Partridge’s reign over The Coliseum for nearly 10 years, he decided to lease the theater/building to a gentlemen named Claude “Dude” Smith in 1934, and the theater continued to prosper with Smith running and managing the theater(6).","Huge fire in 1924, causing $35,000 worth of damage","1. “New Notes from the Northwest.” Moving Picture World, 12 May 1923, p. 187-188.

Ross, Verne Ross","The Dime opened in 1910 under the patronage of local Toledo Sheriff, James H. Ross. This was the first motion pictures theater in Toledo. Originally, the theater was called the Ross Moving Picture House, but that name didn’t stick. In July 1910, only a month after opening, the name was changed to the Dime Theatre, and that was the cost of admission, at least in 1910 (1). The price rose over the years and settled around 25-50 cents for adult admission (2). Ross was not only the sheriff, but he and his family provided much of the musical accompaniment at the theater. His wife sang, his adult daughter, Verne, sang and played piano, and he occasionally played the violin (3). However, Verne did more than just provide music, because almost immediately after her father opened the theater, she took over ownership and ran the business as her own (4). 
The opening announcement of the Ross Moving Picture House, which would be renamed The Dime in just over a month. 
The Lincoln County Leader. Jul. 08, 1910. Historic Oregon Newspapers.Miss Verne Ross was quite the local character. According to records from the Lincoln County Leader that span from 1910 to 1920, Miss Ross not only ran the Dime, but she spent time working as a singer, a deputy, and tax collector, in the Sheriff’s office, a legislative clerk for Salem officials, a stenographer for a real estate agency, a grammar and high school teacher, a grocery store clerk, studying as a student in Berkeley, CA at summer school, and thriving as a socialite around town (5). 

As for the Dime, it’s likely there were additional people running the day to day with Miss Ross’s busy life, but those people are a mystery. However that did not take away from the importance the Dime held in Toledo. The programming was far from strictly moving pictures. Other spectacles included live theatrical performances by traveling actors groups, such as the Nashville Club Players, which came to the Dime on multiple occasions bringing crowd-drawing performances (6). Other programming included Minstrel shows (7), Forestry slides (8), lectures– like a lecture given in 1916 about the Hawaiian Islands (9),– musical clubs, benefits for organizations like the Red Cross and the Boy Scouts (10), recruitment for Logging unions (11), and even trained animals (12). 

      
            This advertisement is a good example of a typical programming ad for the Dime. 
The Lincoln County Leader. Aug. 03, 1917. Historic Oregon Newspapers. 

As a community center, the Dime was a staple in Toledo. For instance, the high school and grammar school graduation ceremonies were held at the Dime every year during this period. In 1917, Toledo High School boasted of a big graduating class of 12 students, all of whom not only had their graduation ceremony at the Dime, but performed there in high school benefits and went as patrons (13). 

 

 

Unfortunately, the finished fate of the Dime is unknown as nearly all mention of the theater vanished from the Lincoln County Leader after 1918. There are faint whispers of its continued operations in 1919 and 1920, but the very last mention of the Dime in this paper occurs on February 4th, 1921, advertising a high school production of “readings and music” (14). It’s clear that whatever came of the Dime, it was a place of community until the very end. 
This is the last mention of the Dime in the Lincoln County Leader. After this, there's no trace of what happened to the theater.

Gordon, Vince Pratt, Livermore","Much of the history on the Dime Theater is focused around those who owned or managed the establishment.1 This suggests the theaters used to reputations of the owners more than the popularity of the movies to promote the theater. Coos Bay, or Marshfield as it was formally known at the time, was still in its early years of development. Meaning the town was small enough for the people to know each other well. The theater rarely advertised when or what kind of programs were going to be held, and when there were advertisements in the paper they were most likely short informal notices. However, when formal advertisements were in newspapers, the information was limited to the price of admission, show title, and time of the showing. 'The Dime' was always large in font and notice within the advertisement suggesting the theater was well-known enough for locals to know where it was located and what it was. Suggesting there were few theaters in the area for showing to occur at during this point in history. Since most advertisements about The Dime didn't include specific addresses it suggests that there were few theaters in the area and The Dime was well known enough in the local community for people to know where it was located.
An advertisement for prices and times at The DimeThe Dime went through several stages of remodel and periods of shut down due to the reconstruction. One article from the Coos Bay Times in 1908 discussed in detail the manager's pride for the newly developed safeguards the theater had placed in the theater.2 Suggesting that consumers had more concern about their safety within an establishment rather than the new technology advancements coming about. The manager even goes as far as to shame another manager at an opposing theater to emphasize the lack of concern of care they are taking into consideration. This is a valid concern by locals considering the highly flammable material theaters were working with. 

      
            The Dime temporarily closes due to maintenanceThere isn't much history on the official start and stop dates of The Dime suggesting that the theater isn't in operation for long or wasn't important enough for the locals to record. Another part of the difficulty could be do the theater having several different periods of closings and reopening.3 The paper never explicitly states how the theater is to be remodeled or what new machinery is being added to the establishment. Suggesting the person writing on the theater wasn't able to get many details on the changes being instated or assumed locals wouldn't care about the changes being made to the theater. Assuming The Dime was one of the few theaters in the Coos Bay Area it is possible locals weren't drawn to the theater because of the experience of being at a theater or even watching films.",NA,"1Coos Bay Times. ""Mrs. F.

Manela, L. A. Peppers","The Dime Theater first opened up on North Main street on October 11th, 1907. It was around for a bit over a year causing it to exist all the way into 1909. Along with many other theaters, it had opened up on a street named Main Street. There were multiple times in which the managers for the theater had switched around. Charles Perkins, one of the managers, had decided to continue opening up theaters and moved away to Washington, causing N. T. Manela and L. A. Peppers to take over the theater. One of the most common things that the theater had done at the beginning to gain attraction was giveaways. In these giveaways, they would be giving out silverware sets from a local business. When this did not work as well they changed it around and started to give out jewelry and watches. After some time, they had realized that it was probably best to focus on their films, and decided to change around their plan of action. Instead of giving out prizes and items, they started to expand more on the theatrical part of using the theater. 

Along with showing films they would also have performances that would occur at the theater. For example, they would have performances by extremely strong people, musical performances, and even performances by actors. One of these performances would prove to be a very negative experience for one of the managers of the theater at the time. Frank Neugebauer, a manager of the theater in 1909 was attacked by a councilman. The councilman had attacked him due to him wanting to cancel their performance at the theater. Frank disliked the performance and did not want it shown at his theater, especially since he had a very positive reputation. ",NA,"""The Dime Theater"" East Oregonian Newspaper, 03/26/1908, p.6

Court St and ran for one year before it’s premature shut down in 1909.  The new parlor was managed by previous Star Theater associate, William Trites and owned by A.C. Friedly. Friedly acquired the Eagles Building, formally recogized as the Eagles Lodge in late 1907. The Eagles building was constructed in 1905 for commercial use and consisted of 3 stories. The architectural style was a combination of Italianate and Richardsonian Romanesque while the construction was mainly made of brick. 

East Oregonian, Jan. 25, 1908, p. 5. Historic Oregon Newspapers.On the evening of January 21, Mr. Friedly and Mr.  Trites premiered one of the theater’s first attractions and moving pictures,  “The Great Passion Play Series,” and sold tickets at 10 cents a piece, deeming it a much more affordable option for Pendleton natives and visitors. According to an advertisement under the amusement section of the East Oregonian, the price was unbeatable compared to the high ticket prices of the same show that premiered at the Marquam Grand Theater in Portland. The theater presented exclusively presented “The Life of Christ” with accompaniment of illustrated songs,-- “Holy City” “In His Steps” and “Palms” on Saturday and Sunday from 12 noon to 10:30 p.m. There was a moving picture change expected to come into affect the following Monday.  The theater later remarked on overflow of crowds it received that week.

 

      
            In advertisement fragments found in the East Oregonian, associates of the Eagle Show Shop usually promoted pictures that were suitable for all ages. The theater consistently released daily and weekly advertisements in the East Oregonian newspaper, updating locals and visitors of new program changes. The company made an effort to play first-class pictures, adding on new titles each week. A few titles included “Race for a Wife” and “Error in Justice” which were all in coloring and accompanied by illustrated songs. 

In early September 1908, an advertisement in the East Oregonian announced that A.C. Friedley secured a synchroscope, an early film and sound-synchronization device invented by German film producer, Jules Greenbaum. In 1908, Greenbaum enlisted contracts with American companies including Carl Laemmle's Movie Service Company in Chicago. According to the short blurb, the Eagle Show Shop Theater was one of three theaters in the northwest to procure this fleeting machine.

Lindsay and Deweese are the only two proprietors listed. Like many other theaters in Oregon, it had opened up on Main Street. Every week there would be a few advertisements in the Eastern Oregonian containing information about times that the theater was open, admission prices, and that they were using the new “Underwriters” machine. It also advertised how they showed both imported and domestic films at this theater. The only location that these advertisements would provide is that the Eidson was “Next to the French Restaurant”. Unlike most theaters they did not offer many incentives to attract more audience members. One incentive that they did advertise was the fact that they had a very special vocalist coming to the theater. Most of the other theaters at this time would have live performances of music by bands or an orchestra, but it was not very common for them to have a vocalist perform. Another thing that was advertised was them using a “mile” of film for one weekend, which at this time was around four films all at once. This was an extremely large amount of film being used for just two days and was not very common for theaters to do so. One bit of controversy that the theater had faced was with the company who provided the theater with their cameragraphs. The manager of the Pyles Cameragraph company had “evaded” the police after getting warned not to continue being a spieler. He was warned by the police that he was not allowed to do this, and he “evaded” the police by buying his own phonograph. The Eidson did not last very long, and eventually was replaced by the Pastime theater in December of that same year. It was common for these smaller theaters to close down or change names very quickly.",NA,"East Oregonian, October 12, 1908, p3, Historic Oregon Newspapers

The Electric Theater was opened in late 1910 and was sold and renamed as the Liberty Theater in late 1917.)

 

The Electric Theater originally operated in the late 1910s-early 1911s as an operating house for electrical shows, a fad sweeping the nation which presented the latest technology to audiences across the USA.

 

The Electric Theater came to establish itself as a nickelodeon. However, the Hood River based theater played host to, outside of its regularly scheduled film screenings, seemingly whatever event was in town at the time. This consisted of vaudeville, music, plays, and even celebrity cameos, such as Paramount star Myrtle Stedman’s 1917 appearance.

 

Vern Whitcomb and Walter Shay were active and considerate owners, accepting criticism and using it to reform their theater. Prominent was the critique of a resurgent smell of dead air, which Whitcomb and Shay eliminated with an innovative air filtration system in November of 1915. Whitcomb and Shay renovated again in 1916, installing new light features to accommodate their theater’s rise in popularity. This rise can certainly be attributed to their eagerness to provide the Hood River population with a setting to watch the blockbusters of their time, going as far as to book high class pictures nearly a month in advance.

 

Whitcomb and Shay were on top of promotional avenues as well. Given the newspaper was a major medium for information on domestic affairs within the late 19th century/early 20th century United States, they utilized it. Whitcomb and Shay used the Hood River based Hood River Glacier to promote shows and events, as well as to provide information about changes or renovations made to the theater.

 

Following a common theme among US theaters at the time, the Electric was renamed to the Liberty Theater in late 1917 following a change of ownership to Judson Herbert Ferguson. A remodel accompanied this, with measures taken by local contractor H. Cramer’s crew to enhance fire safety. The lamp house was renovated with 5 dead air spaces, presumably to delay any fires should they occur, the wiring installed in iron conduit coinciding with local law, and the machinery revamped with automatic “fire shutters”. A new fireproof auditorium floor completed the fire safety renovations. New seating was installed, upping the seating count to 500 available. Continuing the revamp was work done by acclaimed decorator Pierre Taglio, who erected two copies of the Statue of Liberty to coincide with the name change.

      
            Notable facts:

Vern Whitcomb received a special feature in the Local Mention section of the Glacier in 1915. One of the owners of the Electric, Whitcomb suffered an injury to his limb presumably in 1915, which resulted in the amputation of a foot and ankle. Praise modern medicine! 

Former Electric Theater front of house speller Lou Bradford was fined $3 over accusations of his threatening to kill L.A. Grant in 1910. A hefty sum which certainly would have made him think twice before such actions again!",NA,"Book, John. “Cascadian Theatre.” Cinema Treasures, http://cinematreasures.org/theaters/40729.

Hyde originally had worked at a picture house for several years in Portland, but returned to his hometown of Albany to eventually open the 3rd theatre there; Hyde was in charge of the machine while his wife was in charge of the ticket office; admission was 5 cents1. But, what is a grand opening without a little drama? On the grand opening night of the Electric Theatre, the lens was stolen, proving the situation to be dire. But someone who was meant to be his competitor, became an ally; Mr.Stuart of Dreamland, a theatre next to The Electric, was kind enough to give Mr.Hyde a lens and the grand opening was once again on2. Half a year later in October 1910, the Electric underwent new ownership by J. B. Anderson3; between October to February 1911, the theatre had been temporarily closed, where it then underwent one more change of ownership to its final owner of J.D. Harrison. The Electric was eventually sold by Harrison to Messrs. Al. G. Perry and I. G. Richardson, because of his wife's declining health; the theatre became The Cassino, which ended the Electrics' run to just under a year4.

The Electric theatre was set apart from its competitors because it would be straight pictures, without vaudeville; interestingly enough, they had an ad for enquiring about a touring car at The Electric theatre5. This theatre not only exhibited a variety of films for all audiences, but also lectures, comedy shows, boxing fights and more; they showed films like Twixt Loyalty and Love to appeal to women and comedy shows like Australian Gold Fields and Keep Smiling6; some of the lectures exhibited were on the Panama Canal by Wayne O. Adams7. Mr.Harrison even got the world's champion one legged buck and wing dancer as well as high kicker, Chas Bennington as an extra attraction of the week8. For fight pictures, they had advertisements for the Jeffries-Johnson fight. But on the night that thereof was planned to be shown, the Chief of Police Munkers ordered them out (which I'm  assuming is referencing the proprietor, Mr.Harrison), or to be arrested under state law; Harrison was taken back to the agent's hotel, and decided not to show the fight at the Electric9. Now if that's not drama, then I don't know what is.

The Electric was promoted mostly through newspaper ads, likely why it had undergone three different ownerships in the span of less than a year. Though, the theatre did promote a contest with a prize of $200. The contest required viewers to watch a feature film called Romantic Redskins and then write a review to the Independent Western Film Exchange of Portland, Oregon6. Although this ad for the contest was posted on February 4th, 1911, which was two days before it was sold to Messrs. Al. G. Perry and I. G. Richardson and no longer was The Electric, so it's unknown if the contest was still recognized by the new owners or disregarded4. Sadly, because the Electric Theatre's lifespan was so short, there's not much else to report. Though it goes without saying to note the time period and the institutional and societal mannerisms that occur towards people of color, which is far from exempt during the nickelodeon era.",NA,"1. The Electric Theatre, advertisement, The Albany Democrat, March 25, 1910: 3.

Anticipation for The Nickelodion 

      
            The Nickelodion in Portland at 130 Sixth Street, Oregon opened on Saturday, August 4, 1906. The theater was owned and operated by Henry O. Jones until around February 3, 1907, when it was reported in the Sunday Oregonian that the theater had been bought by a Tacoma Company.

From the vague description of the company and the new tech that would make its debut at the theater leads me to infer that the Tacoma Company was based in Tacoma, Washington, which would have been an interesting dynamic on having a theater, let alone a store, in Portland not be locally owned. The Tacoma Company put Joseph St. Peter in charge of the theater until it closed in around October 6, 1908. From this one report, The Nickelodion claimed to be the first theater in Portland to have flickerless projection.

The theater tended to boast of its family friendly entertainment and the variety of shows that were played their after it was taken over by the Tacoma Company. For occasional and popular films, the price of admission would go up from 5 cents to 10 cents. Most of the findings of the theater came from daily or mostly daily ads for the theater and stopped appearing after October 6, 1908, when it could be assumed to have closed around then.",Provided family fun entertainment,"""Hotel Hoyt"", Angelus Studio, 1880/1949, Oregon Digital Database.

It was located on the corner of SW 4th and SW Madison in downtown Corvallis. The building was built due to financial funding and free labor offered by the residents of Corvallis, after its construction it became the first public meeting area in town and was used for a variety of events including multiple functions, dancing, band performances, socials, banquets, and theatre performances. The interior of the Opera House was heated by 3 large wood stove, and consisted of a large horseshoe style seating area that could hold 800 seats. The stage had large 25x14 foot opening. In 1886, the  play, Rice's Evangeline, which is known as the first ever real stage play filled the Opera House to exceed its capacity, with 800 seated and more standing guests. In 1915 the Gazette-Times Newspaper moved into the building and operated out of it until the moved out 1926, leaving it to be destroyed in 1950 to make was for what is now the Benton County bank, However it will not be forgotten as there was a Historical marker placed on the bank in 1984 recognizing the Opera House and the vital role it played in the development of the city. 

      
            The Opera House was not recognized or the role it played as a community center, but also as a landmark to demonstrate the rapid development that took place in the city at the time  As seen in the Sanborn insurance company maps, the first issue of it representing the city showed the Opera house. In September 1888, 18 years after the building was built, it was the only major building in the area.

The Royal,"351 N. Front St. Coos Bay, Oregon","Coos Bay, OR",43° 22.16667' N,124° 12.73333' W,1909-11-02,1909,1914-11-30,1914,500-600,"Robert Marsden, Messr, Pratt, and others, G. J. Lemanski, E. N. Fairchild, Mr. Tope, A. C. Germond","The Royal theater was found on 351 N. Front St. Coos Bay, Oregon, formally known as ‘The Dime’. This theater operated for about 5 years from 1909 to 1914 where it was eventually closed. It has approximately 500-600 seats, including a small balcony. On November 2nd, 1909, the Royal had its grand opening at 7:15pm where they showed the Selig film of 1000 feet, The Cowboy Millionaire, which was released on October 21st of that year; the admission price was 10 cents1.

The Royal had undergone numerous changes in ownership and management throughout its operation. It originally was opened by the mainly Robert Marsden and others; they acted as both owners and managers until G. J. Lemanski bought the Royal from Marsden on August 12th, 19112. Lemanski acted as the main proprietor and manager of the Royal, until he appointed other managers as he owned multiple properties in Coos Bay and in North Bend. Mr. Tope was appointed by Lemanski after the former manager E. N. Fairchild on December 27th, 19123. And then finally the last manager I had found before the Royal closed was A. C. Germond, who began management on March 5th, 19134. In the Winter of 1914, Lemanski had advertised for a new theater he was opening on December 1st, the Noble Theater on Central Avenue. As a result of the new theater, Lemanski decided to close the Royal theater; he left the venue with the fixtures and chairs for special occasions but took out all the machines to most likely move them to his new theater5.

This theater also set itself apart from other competitors by not only the events and films they exhibited, but also by hits physicality. The original owner, Marsden and others, had hired local artist Mr. McLaren to create one of the most realistic pieces that is personal to the Coos Bay community, the curtains which depicted a Coos Bay bar scene; a tug is passing out with a schooner in tow. McLaren also painted other pieces for this theater to create a unique, unforgettable experience for the audience6.

The Royal Theater had a wide range of films that would be exhibited; they showed western dramas like The Golden Ladder, comedies like Man with Three Wives, to even pictures that are interpretations of poems by Whittier10. But to set itself further apart from competition, the theater was also a venue for various entertainments of different means. Because how many theaters can say they had the chance to hold an act by Miss Viola’s circus? In 1913, the Royal held an event for the act, which included animals from various environments around the world; they had Arres from Brazil, monkeys from Columbia, parrots from tropical lands, and so much more. Their star of the show was “Lolotte, the Man Monkey with human intelligence,”7. He supposedly had the ability to do everything a human could do besides the obvious of speech. The rarity of having such an incredible act, let alone a circus act, is almost not worth considering. So when having such an abnormal opportunity present itself, it would be moronic not to drive the ticket prices up. Normally ticket prices ranged from 10 cents to 15 (depending on if you get balcony seating), but in this circumstance of the abnormal act, admission was 25 cents for lower floor; 15 cents for balcony; and 10 cents for children. 25 cents in 1913 to today’s current dollar value is about $7.38; imagine being able to go see a circus act for a mere $7.50!7

Besides the film dramas, what is a theater without a little scandal? The Royal in February 04th of 1914, front page news as they had a fire mishap in the kitchen; one of the stove-pipes and chimney had apparently not been fire proof, and when the board wall alongside the chimney caught and carried the flames into the garret of the building. The defective items had not been approved by the building inspector, to which he said they made the change the day prior and was not passed on by him8. That’s not even the worst incident; on March 30th, 1911, The Royal made front page news once again due to Mrs. Francis Hatton, a performer, being struck by a swinging curtain weight. Hatton was in the act when she was struck and she had sustained very serious injuries. In the attached article titled, Badly Hurt at Royal Theater, Mrs. Hatton apparently wasn’t the first person to get struck; this was the third or fourth incident due to a lack of negligence by the managers in not fixing the curtain weight9. It makes sense why the Royal Theater underwent numerous changes in management throughout the short timespan it was open. And probably the reason why G. J. Lemanski ultimately decided to let this theater finally rest after 5 years, where he saw his luck in just starting completely over and opening the Noble Theater.",NA,"1.

Schwab, Mary Lou deFoeldvar, Felix Antich","The Third Avenue Theater was constructed in 1890 and was located in Old Town Chinatown in Portland, Oregon. Located on the corner of Southwest 3rd Avenue and Burnside St., The Third Avenue Theater was a Burlesque House and presented Vaudeville acts.1 On the Fourth of July in 1934, The Third Avenue Theater ran a small classified ad in the The Oregonian in the Help Wanted section asking for “Amateur Vaudeville Acts.”2 The reason being may be due to the lack of income or profit to hire potential professional Vaudeville acts or possibly for the amateur appeal. Regardless, a few years later in March, 1938, The Oregonian ran another article titled “Long Run In Portland.”3 The article briefly mentions Al and Mrs. Franks, a couple who had been performing in the theater which is “located outside of the theater district.” The article then goes on to describe their tenure at the Third Avenue Theater as a “meal ticket,” which could allude to the possibility that performing at the Third Avenue Theater was not a spectacular money endeavor. Not even a few months later, E. L. Schwab would present his case to “enjoin the Moving Picture Machine Operators local No. 159 from picketing” the Third Avenue Theater for labor controversies.4 Some thirty years down the road, the theater was even a place where the homeless would attend the theater to get some sleep because the cost was very low. The manager at them time, Felix Antich, said that they “open the theater at 5 p.m. and don’t close until 7 a.m.” which makes it a viable option for a place to sleep. Antich mentions in the article that seldom do the men cause any trouble, but often have to be awoken at the 7 a.m close time.5 The theater changed management throughout the years, and one of the latest sources mentioning management appears in 1962. Mary Lou deFoeldvar mentions in a short snippet, in The Oregonian, that the new speaker system has been installed and the heaters have been repaired, and adding “Now all we need are customers.”6 This points to the possible probability that due to the unideal location, the change in management could be due fluctuations in income. In similar fashion, the theater would eventually switch tiles and become known as The Paris Theatre. The Paris Theatre closed down in October 2019 due to structural damage.

W. Ferguson","The Union Theater was reconstructed by Francis Jacobberger in 1922. The theater was built to seat 300 guest and was mainly used as a grind house. It showed off second-rate vaudeville in addition to moving pictures for many years. When Third Avenue was widened in 1930, the front 30 feet of the theater was cut off resulting in a change of the theater’s façade. It also picked up the nickname of the 3rd Avenue Theater around this time.1 In 1963 the theater ceased to be known as the Union Theater and became the Paris. From then it began it’s time as an X-rated video house.

The building of the Union Theater itself has seen many risqué operations in its day. The building officially closed down in October 2019 but before it saw its end it had seen a fair share of people. It is currently considered one of Portland’s many historical buildings and is located in Portland, Oregon’s Old Town Chinatown. The theater was constructed in 1890 and opened as a burlesque house. In 1922 it was renovated to operate as a cinema. Sixteen years after it became the Paris it became home to local drama groups before closing. It the reopened as a video-projection porno house until 2016. It then became a part of Portland’s night life and was utilized as a live venue and nightclub until it finally closed its doors in 2019.2

            During its time the Union Theater was a popular motion picture location in the Portland area. It regularly showed popular movies that were being premiered that year. The Union Theater even participated in national film events such as the Paramount Pictures Nationwide Anniversary Celebration.3 Since the building itself has been around since the 1890s when the 'Union Theater' title and ownership officially ceases is difficult to determine. This is because the history of the Paris Theater and the history of the Union Theater often overlap due to the shared history of the building itself.

            When Douglas Fairbanks, Mary Pickford, Charlie Chaplin and D.W. Griffith founded United Artists in 1919, it was inevitable that United Artists would play large part in the film industry. Within ten years, United Artists had spread it's control over the film industry to the east coast and back. United Artists built their theater chain and it finally landed in the Northwest in Portland, Oregon, when J.J. Parker bought the Majestic Theater. In 1929 J.J. Parker struck a deal with Fox  West Coast Theaters and would soon become an owner of well over nine theaters in Portland. Parker was no stranger to theaters though and was in fact well known and well respected among theater owners in Oregon. 

Besides the deal that was formed between Parker and Fox West Coast Theaters, there isn't a huge variety of information on the United Artists Theaters itself. In fact, at the time of it's opening in Portland, the United Artists Theater chain wasn't all that big. From 1929-1934, United Artists only had 15-17 theaters nationwide. And as far as advertisements for the theater, well, it didn't need any due to it's connection with four of the biggest names in the film industry as well as a popular theater owner in Portland. When the Code Authority Announced its forty-two local code boards were announced, it was no surprise that J.J. Parker was on the list of representatives of the Grievance Board for the state of Oregon.",NA,"The Advocate, February 22, 1930, page 1

Lippert Theatres Inc., Coming Attractions Theatres","The Varsity theater, located in the small town of Ashland, Oregon, has continued to be a necessity for movie patrons from its first opening in 1937 to the present day.  Its credibility and reputation in the city of Ashland have allowed it to become a favorite amongst the community. The Varsity theater has shown an array of content due to its long run as a movie theatre. In its early advertisements, it showed films such as Kind Hearts and Coronets. This film was a part of the Varsity’s “Curtain at Eight Thirty” promotion, which was targeted to the “discriminating film patron”(1). This promotion showed a series of “off-beat” motion pictures that welcomed a diverse array of movie-goers. The Varsity’s dedication to creating a theatre environment that welcomes everyone, even the discrimination film patrons, speaks volumes to why their theatre has lasted as long as it has. Currently, the Varsity shows predominantly art and independent films as well as box office hits (2). Their willingness to change and adapt in order to please the film patrons of Ashland is why the Varsity has become such a household name for their community.

The Varsity didn’t particularly need to advertise for themselves in order to remain a successful business, their presence in the Ashland community allowed them to gain a lot of traction in local newspapers and articles without having to pay for advertising. For example, In Rogue News, their theatre was advertised due to the fact that they were hosting an event for Ashland High School at their theater(3).  Another example is shown in an advertisement for Elmart Music Shop. Their ad states, “We have moved across the street. Between Varsity Theatre and Mark Antony Hotel” (4). Although this doesn’t seem like purposeful advertising, the Varsity is still getting its name in local newspapers due to the familiarity of their theatre and its location. It causes people to see the Varsity as a strong presence throughout their city.",NA,"1. Historic Oregon Newspapers, University of Oregon Library. “Rogue News, December 13, 1968, Image 3.” Ashland, Oregon, Journal Print Co.

     The significance behind this theater is that it was the first of its kind in Salem. A town where multiple theaters already existed and were sure to provide some competition. During a time where movie-going was already gaining some traction, the Vaudette provided more accessibility to those who could not otherwise afford more expensive forms of entertainment. Advertisements for this theater would be placed next to several other promotions for the town's remaining amusement destinations, which can be seen to the right. However, in the face of competition, the Vaudette and the Dreamland theater were owned by the same woman, which provided some intriguing promotional tactics. Watson would choose different forms of entertainment for each theater, but urge readers to come and see both, seen below. That way, she could kill two birds with one stone, by delivering diverse entertainment options while promoting both of her businesses. Other unique forms of advertising brought some deserved attention to this town addition, such as a glass panel being replaced with a phonograph horn that could be heard blocks away. As well as having free shows for children under the age of 10. Because of this new destination and its promotional techniques, movie-goers expressed much gratitude for the place that pioneered ""high-class five-cent"" experiences for both children and families in the town of Salem.
Daily Oregon Statesman, April 4, 1909, p5, Newspapers.com.
      
                 Located between Court and Liberty Street in Salem, Oregon, the Vaudette Theatre was a place for amusement and accessibility for movie-goers and those who enjoyed exciting yet affordable entertainment, specifically targeting families who needed a more low-cost option. Opening in June of 1907 and as Salem's first 5-cent theater, managers, Messrs. T. B. Morgan and H. E. Perry would use their new modern equipment in order to provide their famous demonstrations of moving pictures and illustrated songs, as seen to the left. Besides being a place for moving pictures, the theater would host a variety of events such as, singing performances with Mrs. Hallie Parrish Hinges accompanied by orchestras, and popular plays such as ""Passion Play"", which was a big expense but a popular presentation for the theater. More importantly, the Vaudette would be a place of politics, by showing 17 different screenings regarding child labor views as seen in the gallery below. Mrs. M. E. Watson, who owned not one, but two theaters in Salem including the Dreamland, focused her efforts to have sufficient forms of entertainment at both locations. Having the more popular ones such as a three-piece ladies orchestra and the ""Oregon Nightingale"" at the Vaudette. It would be a place where families could gather without the stress of having to pay high prices, and children could enjoy a variety of screenings, plays, and other features that would prove to be a hit. The popularity of the theater was clearly evident, as the local newspaper made a special effort to mention Vaudette Theatre on various occasions and the fun that it has attracted, seen in the gallery. With a program switch twice a week, on Wednesdays and Saturdays, the people of Salem were guaranteed to never get bored with these ever-changing amusement options.

Venetian Theatre,"233 E Main St, Hillsboro, Oregon","Hillsboro, OR",45° 31.36667' N,122° 59.23333' W,1921-01-01,1921,2017-01-01,2017,800,"Orange ""Pappy"" Phelps , Vincent Phelps","Venetian Theatre Auditorium. Image courtesy of venetian- theatre.com.The original building, which hosts the Venetian Theatre, was built in 1888 as the First National Bank of Hillsboro. In 1911 Orange “Pappy” Phelps, the mayor of Hillsboro, converted the bank into a theater, naming it The Grand Theater. This was not Phelps first theater experience. He was a very successful theater operator. In 1908 he opened the Arcade Theater also in downtown Hillsboro, while also working as a booking agent for the Crescent Theater. He also operated the Majestic Theater in downtown Hillsboro from 1916 to 1917 and the Hill Theatre in 1937. In 1952, in partnership with his son, Phelps opened the county’s very first drive-in theater called the CarVue near Cornelius.

The Grand Theater originally had 200 seats, and after a renovation in 1915, it was expanded to 500 seats and renamed the Liberty Theater to sound more patriotic during the World War II era. In 1919, Phelps purchased a $6,000 pipe organ for the theater. The Hillsboro Argus reported, “The big musical instrument is one of the best in the state outside of Portland and will be an innovation in theatre circles” (1). 
After the 1925 fire. Image courtesy of venetian-theatre.com.A fire in 1925 then destroyed the theater and Phelps was once again forced to rebuild. This rebuild converted the building into a two-story building, and Phelps renamed the theater The Venetian. This rebuild was done in “Italianate-style architecture, an ornate entranceway, and murals depicting Italian scenes” (3). The theater was then large enough to show full-scale vaudeville shows and silent movies. The Ten Commandments by Cecil B. DeMille was the theater’s opening night musical. 

“When talkies replaced silent films, Phelps added Vitaphone, a sound-on-disc process in which recorded voices and music were synchronized with the film” (3). The Hillsboro Argus reported, “This machine is the ‘last word’ in projection and produces a picture which for clearness, steadiness

 

 

      
            Venetian Theatre Stage. Image courtesy of venetian- theatre.com.and perfection keeps pace with the advancement in the cinema world” (7). In 1929, The Broadway Melody was the very first film with sound to be shown at the theater, and in Hillsboro. Over one thousand guests were in attendance. 

The Venetian used newspaper advertisements and articles describing upcoming movies and shows, such as The Saphead, which stared the world-renowned actor Buster Keaton (9). Phelps truly loved his theater and community so much, he offered free films during the Great Depression, specifically on holidays, so that families could enjoy them. Phelps also held other fun activities aside from movies at the theater, such as graduations, live performances, 4H club shows, cooking shows, and benefits (2) (12). 
Vitaphone Image, The Hillsboro Argus, Apr. 1, 1920, Image 2. Historic Oregon Newspapers.In 1956, another fire destroyed the building. Phelps rebuilt within one year, increasing the auditorium to 800 seats and renaming it Town Theater. In 1976 Phelps, who was in his nineties, turned the theater over to his son Vincent. Two years after Vincent became owner, he sold the theater to Tom Moyer Luxury Theaters. It was taken over again multiple times, and by 1996 the building was in such poor shape it was boarded up, and the city purchased it for $1,500. 

In 2007, the building was scheduled to be demolished. A developer named Denzil Scheller purchased the building and paid $2.5 million to renovate and bring the building completely up to city code. In July of 2008, Scheller decided to rename the theater back to The Venetian and reopen as a performing arts center. Some improvements include: “a bright neon marquee, a red tile roof, a wrought-iron balcony, a 370-seat auditorium, and a European-style bistro” (1). 

The Venetian was awarded Oregon’s Outstanding Achievement in Design Award and was central to building up the downtown area (1). The theater has been temporarily closed since April 2017 while the current owner attempts to find a buyer. Orange Phelps died in 1985 in Oregon at the age of 98.

Hunt, H.B. Hurst","Constructed in 1914, the Vining theater was highly anticipated amongst the citizens of Ashland. It was built under the ownership of Robert and Irving Vining, and as two well-known members of the community, the theater was to become the social hub of the city (1). Contracting architects and carpenters from across the Pacific Northwest, the theater was to be a place of class and artistry, as an article from the Ashland Tidings illustrates, ""...the decorators have placed much of the stucco work which adorns the theater and are giving a foretaste of the magnificence of the interior...,"" (2).

After months of waiting and preparing, the Vining theater finally announced its opening night, where it would showcase the New York Opera Company's ""Faust"", considered to be one of the most difficult operas to perform (3). The city of Ashland would go all out for the theaters opening night, as all of the box seats were sold out before the showcase, and retailers such as Minkler's Cloak and Suit House made advertisements selling the proper 'high-class' attire to those who would be attending (4). 
Ashland Tidings, May 11th, 1914, p.1 Historic Oregon NewspapersThe opening night for the Vining was a huge success, as audiences coming from all over southern Oregon went to see shows in this Ashland theater. Vaudeville acts and photoplays were popular features to be shown, but this wasn't the only entertainment locals enjoyed attending. In 1917, the Oregon Agricultural College glee club performed at the Vining on their yearly tour through Oregon cities (5). A  few years later, Magician Blackstone did a show at the theater, using the 'powers of the subconscious mind' to perform his magic tricks (6). 

      
            As photoplays became more accessible and a popular form of entertainment during the nineteen-teens and early twenties, the Vining theater capitalized on advertising for the films they showcased. One of the promotional strategies they used was revealing a local celebrity connection to young actress Mary Pickford, as the front page news article from the Ashland Tidings details Pickford being the niece of Ashlander Judge Watson (7). The theater often used Mary Pickford and her connection to Ashland as a way to promote her films being showcased, as displayed in the advertisement from the Ashland Tidings, calling her a ""favorite"" in town (8). 
Ashland Tidings, June 8th, 1914, p.4 Historic Oregon Newspapers Though a local gem and popular attraction for more than a decade, the Vining theater had come to a close in 1932 after going through several owner changes over the course of its existence. Once bought out by owner H.B. Hurst in 1922 from ex-owners Mr. and Mrs. Bergner, the theaters name would last up until the spring of 1932, when the first appearance of the Hurst theater would be advertised in Rogue News on May 20th (9).","The theater contained box, balcony, and gallery seating as well as the tradition lower floor seating, The theater was utilized for more than just photoplays and vaudeville shows, as it was also used for community events","1.

This newspaper advertisement obtained from The Daily Capital Journal, specifically from the Newspapers.com database, is not a big article with plentiful information, however it does provide some useful details about the theater such as the initial price of entry as well as some of the equipment used there. For example, according to this newspaper ad, we can see that admission cost was priced at ten cents, and they used a ""Fine Machine Powers' Cameragraph No.6"" in the theater. I also found it interesting how the ad states ""everybody welcome"" because I am not 100% sure this is accurate for the time this theater was running. In class we have been learning about racial discrimination and segregation throughout the state of Oregon that occurred in movie theaters such as the Star Theater in Portland. Specifically black families, for example, William D. Allen and Oliver Taylor were both discriminated at the Star and they went on to sue the proprietor of the theater. With examples like those prevalent in Portland which is located only a couple hours away from the Wexford in Salem, I am very suspicious that ""Everybody Welcome"" may not be the reality of the situation. Further on I plan on doing more research regarding racism at the Wexford to see if similar behaviors are prevalent here.

            This is a newspaper article that I also found from the Daily Capital Journal in the Newspapers.com database. It is dated as being published on January 25th the following year of its grand opening which means there has been quite a bit of time for the theater successfully running with people visiting and enjoying the space there. It was so successful in fact that the “popular manager” of the Wexford, George Rosner, was able to purchase a beautiful pipe organ at the cost of $4,000 to be installed in the theater. The article claims that the pipe organ was the most expensive in the Willamette Valley outside of Portland and was the largest at the time to be installed in a moving picture house in all of the United States. The article then goes on to praise George Rosner for adding the organ and it seems like the people really like his ownership and the form in which he runs the theater because he added this instrument to the building. Even though this organ was one of the biggest in the country, Rosner apparently condensed the organ’s length to avoid interfering with the seating which I thought was really cool. Although the addition of music was very important, Rosner still wanted to keep the comfortableness of the people in mind.",NA,NA

            The Whiteside opened with The Old Homestead. The theater was mainly built for cinema, though there were also live productions that were presented on stage. (1)

Since the Whiteside Brothers were such well known and successful businessmen in Corvallis at the time, the Whiteside Theatre was already seen by everyone as a huge success before it even fully opened. During and shortly after the opening, the newspapers were filled with tie-ins of local companies promoting both themselves and the new theater in the newspapers. The below advertisement is from Builders Supply Company promoting “Face Brick,” the brick used to build the beautiful Whiteside Theatre, which “looks rich enough to be a million dollar building.” (2)

            On the 19th of October, 1927, a fire destroyed the interior of the theater. Everyone in the theater at the time (roughly 50 patrons) managed to escape safely. Fortunately, the fire department was across the street and the fireman were able to put out the fire. However, the theater suffered over $50,000 in damage. The interior of the theater was completely remodeled soon after, with a brand new Wurlitzer organ, cove lighting and chandelier.

On December 26, 1928, the Whiteside Theatre showed the first talking film in Corvallis, Lonesome, which starred Glenn Tyron and Barbara Kent. It was advertised as “a perfect talking picture” – “Talk where talking is needed, silence where silence is golden.”

They promoted the fact that they had a unique aesthetic with local art used as decor. As well as the fact that the audience could pay half the price to view a program that was still enjoyable and entertaining.

The opening of the new Wonderland theater meant that citizens had a choice between a ‘good’ program that was only 5 cents or a ‘full’ program at the Dreamland that would cost them double the price. These theaters were located right next door to one another.

A brief article in the Albany Democrat reported that the Wonderland's opening night  was successful and many people attended.

            Ye Liberty opened in early September 1908 to a large crowd of 1,000 people who were nonetheless disappointed when there wasn't enough electricity to run the projector.

In the late teens and early twenties, Ye Liberty tended to only use large newspaper spreads to advertise key films. Key actors or directors might receive a quarter-page ad once a week. Other than that Ye Liberty’s  promotional methods were small box ads and some small blurbs promoting other films. Certain films received only one or two days of advertising, while others, like D.W. Griffith’s Her Condoned Sin received promotion for weeks before they opened. Still, quarter-page ads for Ye Liberty films were relatively rare compared to those appearing in newspapers for films showing at other theaters. It may be that Ye Liberty provided a different fare than these other theaters, or simply that Frank Bligh chose a different newspaper tactic.

An exception to this trend is an advertising spread for the “Fifth Annual Paramount Week” in early September of 1922. During this week a series of Paramount productions were shown at Ye Liberty and the Oregon Theatres. Four full pages, advertising the films being shown and presenting numerous screen captures from the films, were added to the back of the Statesman Journal on this occasion.

T. G. Bligh, owner of Ye Liberty in the mid-nineteen-teens, was extolled in Salem for his philanthropy. One example of this in Ye Liberty’s commercial practices occurred in 1916, when he agreed to show Veda the Vampire, a film which had been produced in nearby Portland. The film was a purely home-grown project, being filmed in the homes of some of Portland’s most well-known residents, written by a local Portland man, and casting local talent in some of the roles. The proceeds from the film’s showing at Ye Liberty were to go to benefit an old people’s home in Portland, and the papers made much of the generous spirit of the multiple Salem exhibitors who agreed to show it as a charity fundraiser.

In 1917 Ye Liberty appears to have slightly rebranded itself, dropping “Ye” from its name in most cases. Beginning in July, the generic black-bordered box that advertised upcoming films began saying simply “Liberty Theatre.” Usage of the name is inconsistent in Salem papers, but by the early 1920s, most references to the theater seem to refer it as “the Liberty.” No change of management is known to have taken place in 1917, and it is likely that Frank Bligh simply changed the name in an attempt at modernization.

The theater closed in spring 1925 and was remodeled into a department store.
