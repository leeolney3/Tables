Caveats:
"1. As of April 3, 2017, the underlying cause of death has been revised for 125 deaths in 2014. More information:"
"http://wonder.cdc.gov/wonder/help/ucd.html#2014-Revision."
"2. Circumstances in Georgia for the years 2008 and 2009 have resulted in unusually high death counts for the ICD-10 cause of"
"death code R99, ""Other ill-defined and unspecified causes of mortality."" Caution should be used in interpreting these data."
"More information: http://wonder.cdc.gov/wonder/help/ucd.html#Georgia-Reporting-Anomalies."
"3. Circumstances in New Jersey for the year 2009 have resulted in unusually high death counts for the ICD-10 cause of death code"
"R99, ""Other ill-defined and unspecified causes of mortality"" and therefore unusually low death counts in other ICD-10 codes,"
"most notably R95, ""Sudden Infant Death Syndrome"" and X40-X49, ""Unintentional poisoning."" Caution should be used in"
"interpreting these data. More information: http://wonder.cdc.gov/wonder/help/ucd.html#New-Jersey-Reporting-Anomalies."
"4. Circumstances in California resulted in unusually high death counts for the ICD-10 cause of death code R99, ""Other"

"5. Death rates are flagged as Unreliable when the rate is calculated with a numerator of 20 or less. More information:"
"http://wonder.cdc.gov/wonder/help/ucd.html#Unreliable."
"6. Deaths of persons with Age ""Not Stated"" are included in ""All"" counts and rates, but are not distributed among age groups,"
