",, No help i am a renter with active lease and rent receipts for my past paid rent never missed a payment and now the house is foreclosed on by the bank because my landlord apparently wasn't paying her mortgage. I know the bank has to honor lease by law but don't know who or how to get ahold of anybody to help us take care of this no water situation and the county is threatening to red tag the house this morning August 16th. If water isn't back working. Governor Newsom has declared state of emergency and Lake County is one of the County's on the list. being it's a drought can they really red tag us since it's of our hands? Believe it's the bank attempting a shady way of getting us off the property. Hoping they don't have to honor our lease if we just leave. Please help us. Were not squatters nor are we trying to stay longer then our lease. But to try telling us we need to be gone in a week allows no time to get our belongings much less find a place.

Locally, Worsham Pump Co. in Vacaville, CA reports a high demand for well service, testing, replacement wells and pump extensions.  They are overbooked for appointments into next year. They are a reliable source that can provide an overview of our areas declining groundwater.  Near me, Ledgewood Creek dried up entirely this year, for the first time in 70 years. Massive planting of new vineyards has been underway in my region of Suisun Valley.  Evidence of a wide ranging land and water grab by the wine industry.
